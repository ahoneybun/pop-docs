The Ubuntu community is made up of software developers, translators, folks who love to write documentation, and most importantly the people who use Ubuntu every day. We invite you to join this community and help to make Ubuntu the operating system your family, friends, and office colleagues will love to use. Help to translate Ubuntu into your own language, test it on new laptops, servers and other exciting hardware, improve the web site with hints, tips and FAQ's, or help to define the set of software that is installed by default for future Ubuntu releases."

msgid "Built on the solid and advanced base of Debian, the Ubuntu team aims to create a distribution that provides an up-to-date and coherent GNU/Linux system for desktop and server computing. Ubuntu includes a number of selected packages from the Debian distribution and is based on its powerful &quot;APT&quot; package management system. APT allows easy installation and clean removal of programs, as well as automatic download of extra packages to satisfy dependencies. Unlike most distributions that ship a wide range of software packages that may or may not be of quality, Ubuntu's core list of packages is reduced to only the important applications. (Although for maximum choice, you may choose from the full list, rather than being limited to the high quality core.)"

Ubuntu ships with versions for i386 (Pentium CPUs / IBM-compatible PCs), AMD-64 (Hammer) and PowerPC (iBook/Powerbook, G4 and G5) architectures."
