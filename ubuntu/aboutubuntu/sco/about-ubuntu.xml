                    <para>Houaniver, this means mair than jist bein available at nae cost.  The philosophy o free saftware is that fowk shoud be free tae uiss saftware in aw the weys that are "socially uissfu". "Free saftware" disna jist mean that ye shouldna hae tae pey for it, it means that ye shoud be able tae uiss the saftware in ony wey ye want an aw: the code that maks up free saftware is available for onybody tae download, cheenge, mend, an uiss in ony wey.  So apairt frae the fact that free saftware is aften available athoor chairge, this freedom haes technical advantages an aw: whan programmes are developit, the haurd wark o ithers can be uised an biggit upon.  Wi non-free saftware, this canna happen an whan programs are developit, they hae tae stert frae scratch.  For this reason the development o free saftware is fast, feckfu an excitin!</para>
