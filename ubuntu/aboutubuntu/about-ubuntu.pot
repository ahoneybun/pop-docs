The project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete operating system which is free software: the GNU system. GNU is a recursive acronym for “GNU's Not UNIX” that reflects the fact that the GNU environment follows the design principles and replicates many of the commands of UNIX, but is in fact a completely independent implementation."

It can be essentially summarized like this: \"Free software is a matter of freedom: people should be free to use software in all the ways that are socially useful\". \"Free software\" does not mean that you shouldn't have to pay for it, it also means that you should be able to use the software in any way you wish: the code that makes up free software is available for anyone to download, change, fix, and use in any way. So apart from the fact that free software is often available without charge, this freedom also has technical advantages: when programs are developed, the hard work of others can be used and built upon. With non-free software, this cannot happen and when programs are developed, they have to start from scratch. For this reason the development of free software is fast, efficient and exciting!"

Linux is a \"kernel\", it is the core piece of software that starts up when you turn your computer on, and it in turn runs all of the other applications that make up the whole desktop environment. In many ways it's a tiny part of the whole mix, but its role is so important that many people describe the whole desktop as \"Linux\". Linux is the software which has come to define the worldwide movement to embrace free software. Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the Linux kernel, are now widely used; though these systems are often referred to as “Linux,” they are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems. Today we use the Linux kernel together with many of the GNU applications. That's why we call Ubuntu an example of GNU/Linux software.
