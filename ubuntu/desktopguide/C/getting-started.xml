		<para>Ubuntu is an entirely open source operating system built around the

                by people in their local language and despite any disabilities,
                and that people should have the freedom to customize and alter
                their software in whatever way they see fit. For those reasons:

							<para>Ubuntu is a South African ethical ideology focusing on
                        people&apos;s allegiances and relations with each other. The
                        word comes from the Zulu and Xhosa languages. Ubuntu
                        (pronounced &quot;oo-BOON-too&quot;) is seen as a
                        traditional African concept, is regarded as one of the
                        founding principles of the new republic of South Africa
                        and is connected to the idea of an African Renaissance.

							<para>A rough translation of the principle of Ubuntu is
                        &quot;humanity towards others&quot;. Another
                        translation could be: &quot;the belief in a
                        universal bond of sharing that connects all
                        humanity&quot;.

                        principles of open source software development; people

								</para>
                    <para>However, this means more than just being available at zero cost. The philosophy of free software is that people should be free to use software in all the ways that are &quot;socially useful&quot;. &quot;Free software&quot; doesn't just mean that you shouldn&apos;t have to pay for it, it also means that you should be able to use the software in any way you wish: the code that makes up free software is available for anyone to download, change, fix, and use in any way. So apart from the fact that free software is often available without charge, this freedom also has technical advantages: when programs are developed, the hard work of others can be used and built upon. With non-free software, this cannot happen and when programs are developed, they have to start from scratch. For this reason the development of free software is fast, efficient and exciting!

                    	<para>There are many different operating systems based on GNU/Linux:
 	                 Debian, SuSE, Gentoo, RedHat, and Mandriva are examples. 
			   Ubuntu is yet another contender in what
                        is already a highly competitive world. So what makes
                        Ubuntu different?
							</para>
                    	<para>Based on Debian, one of the most widely acclaimed,
                        technologically advanced, and well-supported
                        distributions, Ubuntu
                        aims to create a distribution that provides
                        an up-to-date and coherent Linux system for desktop and
                        server computing. Ubuntu includes a number of carefully
                        selected packages from the Debian distribution and
                        retains its powerful package management system which
                        allows easy installation and clean removal of programs. Unlike most
                        distributions that ship with a large amount of software
                        that may or may not be of use, Ubuntu&apos;s list of packages
                        is reduced to a number of important applications of high
                        quality.
							</para>

                        project takes the time required to focus on finer
                        details and is able to release a version featuring the
                        latest and greatest of today&apos;s software once every 6
                        months. Ubuntu is available in flavours for the i386
                        (386/486/Pentium(II/III/IV) and Athlon/Duron/Sempron
                        processors), AMD64 (Athlon64, Opteron, and new 64-bit
                        Intel processors), and PowerPC (iBook/Powerbook, G4 and

	<title>Linux Basics</title>
				<para>Linux is inspired by the Unix operating system which first appeared in 1969, and has been in continous use and development ever since. Many of the design conventions behind Unix also exist in Linux and are central to understanding the basics of the system.
				</para>
				<para>Unix was primarily oriented towards the command line interface, and that legacy is carried on in Linux. Thus, the graphical user interface with its windows, icons and menus are built on top of a basic command line interface. Furthermore, this means that the Linux file system is structured to be easily manageable and accessible from the command line.
				</para>
		<sect2 id="directories-file-systems" status="complete">
			<title>Directories and File Systems</title>
				<para>Linux and Unix file systems are organised in a hierarchical, tree-like structure.  The highest level of the file system is the <filename>/</filename> or <emphasis>root directory</emphasis>.  In the Unix and Linux design philosophy, everything is considered a file - including hard disks, partitions and removable media. This means that all other files and directories (including other disks and partitions) exist under the root directory.
				</para>
				<para>For example, <filename>/home/jebediah/cheeses.odt</filename> shows the correct full path to the <filename>cheeses.odt</filename> file that exists in the <filename>jebediah</filename> directory which is under the <filename>home</filename> directory, which in turn, is under the root (<filename>/</filename>) directory.
				</para>
				<para>Underneath the root (<filename>/</filename>) directory, there is a set of important system directories that are common across most Linux distributions that are used.  The following is a listing of common directories that are directly under the root (<filename>/</filename>) directory:

			<title>Root And Sudo</title>
			<para>The root user in GNU/Linux is the user which has administrative access to your system. Normal users do not have this access for security reasons. However, Ubuntu does not include the root user. Instead, administrative access is given to individual users, who may use the "sudo" application to perform administrative tasks. The first user account you created on your system during installation will, by default, have access to sudo. You can restrict and enable sudo access to users with the <application>Users and Groups</application> application (see <xref linkend="users-and-groups"/> for more information).
			</para>
			<para>When you run an application that requires root privileges, sudo will ask you to input your normal user password. This ensures that rogue applications cannot damage your system, and serves as a reminder that you are about to perform administrative actions which require you to be careful!
			</para>
			<para>To use sudo when using the command line, simply type "sudo" before the command you wish to run. Sudo will then prompt you for your password.
			</para>
			<para>Sudo will remember your password for a set amount of time. This feature was designed to allow users to perform multiple administrative tasks without being asked for a password each time.

		<title>Terminals</title>
            <para>Working at the command line is not as daunting a task
                as you would think. There is no special knowledge needed to know
                how to use the command line, it is a program like everything
                else. Most things in Linux can be done using the command line,
                although there are graphical tools for most programs, sometimes
                they are just not enough. This is where the command line comes
                in handy.
				</para>
    	      <para>The terminal is often called the command prompt
		    or the shell.  In days gone by, this was the way the
                    user interacted with the computer, however Linux users have
                    found that the use of the shell can be quicker than a
                    graphical method and still holds some merit today. Here you
                    will learn how to use the terminal.
				</para>
				<para>The original use of the terminal was a file browser and
                    indeed it is still used as a file browser, in the event of
                    the graphical environment failing.  You can use the terminal
                    as a file browser to navigate your files and undo the
                    changes that have been made.
