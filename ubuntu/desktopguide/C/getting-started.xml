                -- our &distro-version; release.</para>
            <para id="about1">Ubuntu Linux is an entirely open source operating
                system built around the Linux kernel. The Ubuntu community is
                comprised of developers, programmers, testers, techwriters,
                documentation testers, translators, and most importantly, the
                people who use Ubuntu every day. We invite you to join this
                community and help make Ubuntu the operating system you, your
                family, your friends, and your colleages will love to use. Help
                us translate Ubuntu into your language, try it on new and
                unusual hardware, improve the experience of other users with
                hints, tips, and FAQs, or help to shape the direction Ubuntu is
                headed by providing feedback about the software you love most.</para>
            <para id="about2">The Ubuntu community is built around the ideals
                enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto: that software should be
                available free of charge, that software tools should be usable
                by people in their local language and despite any disabilities,
                and that people should have the freedom to customize and alter
                their software in whatever way they see fit. For those reasons: <itemizedlist>

                    <para>On hearing the name &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, many
                        people are curious about the meaning of the word.</para>
                    <para>Ubuntu is a South African ethic ideology focusing on
                        people's allegiances and relations with each other. The
                        word comes from the Zulu and Xhosa languages. Ubuntu,
                        pronounced &quot;oo-BOON-too,&quot; is seen as a
                        traditional African concept and is held as one of the
                        founding principles of the new republic of South Africa
                        and connected to the idea of an African Renaissance.</para>
                    <para>A rough translation of Ubuntu's principles could be
                        &quot;humanity towards others.&quot; Another
                        translation could be: &quot;The belief in a
                        universal bond of sharing that connects all
                        humanity.&quot;</para>
                    <para>&quot;A person with ubuntu is open and available
                        to others, affirming of others, does not feel threatened
                        that others are able and good, for he or she has a
                        proper self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or
                        she belongs in a greater whole and is diminished when
                        others are humiliated or diminished, when others are

                    <title>The Difference</title>
                    <para>There are many GNU/Linux distributions in the world,
                        some are built from the ground up and some are based on
                        others; each has aimed to perfect the platform and its
                        desktop. However, only a few survive, with names such as
                        Debian, SuSE, Gentoo, RedHat, and Mandrake being the
                        most notable.</para>
                    <para>Based on Debian, one of the most widely acclaimed,
                        technologically advanced, and well-supported
                        distributions, Ubuntu is yet another contender in what
                        is already a highly competitive world. So what makes
                        Ubuntu different?</para>
                    <para>With its solid and advanced Debian foundation, Ubuntu
                        aims to create a Debian-based distribution that provides
                        an up-to-date and coherent Linux system for desktop and
                        server computing. Ubuntu includes a number of carefully
                        selected packages from the Debian distribution and
                        retains its powerful package management system which
                        allows easy installation and clean removal of programs,
                        as well as automatically handling any dependencies
                        programs may have on each other. Unlike most
                        distributions that ship with a large amount of software
                        that may or may not be of use, Ubuntu's list of packages
                        is reduced to a number of important applications of high
                        quality.</para>
                    <para>By focusing on quality, Ubuntu produces a robust and
                        feature-rich computing environment that is suitable for
                        use in both home and commercial environments. The
                        project takes the time required to focus on finer
                        details and is able to release a version featuring the
                        latest and greatest of today's software once every 6
                        months. Ubuntu is available in flavours for the i386
                        (386/486/Pentium(II/III/IV) and Athlon/Duron/Sempron
                        processors), AMD64 (Athlon64, Opteron, and new 64-bit
                        Intel processors), and PowerPC (iBook/Powerbook, G4 and
                        G5) architectures.</para>

                        to the efforts of the Kubuntu team, Ubuntu users are now
                        able to install and use the KDE desktop easily on their
                        system. To get a working install of Kubuntu on an Ubuntu
			 install, run the following command: sudo apt-get install 
			kubuntu-desktop.  Once kubuntu-desktop is installed, one 
			can choose to use either a Gnome or KDE desktop environment.

            <title>What is Linux?</title>
            <para>Contrary to what you may have heard from the media, from
                friends, or from the Internet, Linux is not an operating system.
                What is commonly referred to as "Linux" is actually a combination
		of <ulink url="&gnu;">GNU</ulink>, pronounced "guh-noo", software
		 and the <ulink url="&kernel;">Linux kernel</ulink>, pronounced
		&apos;lee-nucks&apos;.  A kernel is an important part of
                any operating system, providing the communicaton bridge between 
                hardware and software.</para>
            <para>Linux was brought to life in 1991 by a Finnish student named
                Linus Torvalds. At the time, it would run only on i386 systems,
                and was essentially an independently created clone of the UNIX
                kernel, intended to take advantage of the then-new i386
                architecture.</para>
            <para>Nowadays, thanks to a substantial amount of development
                effort, Linux runs on virtually every modern architecture, and
                GNU software provides the necessary tools to make it useful.
                Conceptually, Linux is the heart of the GNU/Linux operating
                system model, and GNU is the body. Distributions, such as
                Ubuntu, which provide GNU/Linux as well as a number of useful
                programs, are operating systems.</para>
            <para>To summarize, Ubuntu is an operating system based on the
                GNU/Linux model, with Linux being the kernel.</para>
            <para>However, beyond the technical definition of Linux, there
                exists an entire community of people who believe in the ideals
                of free software and spend their time helping to make open
                source technology as good as it can be.</para>
            <para>People in this community gave rise to initiatives such as
                Ubuntu, standards commitees that shape the development of the
                Internet, organizations like the Mozilla Foundation, responsible
                for creating Mozilla Firefox, and countless other software
                projects from which you've certainly benefitted in the past.</para>
            <para>The spirit of open source, commonly attributed to Linux, is

            <title>What is GNU?</title>
            <para>The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete
                UNIX style operating system which is comprised of free software: the GNU
                system. (GNU is a recursive acronym for “GNU's Not UNIX”; it is
                pronounced “guh-noo.”) Variants of the GNU operating system,
                which use the Linux kernel, are now widely used; though these
                systems are often referred to as “Linux,” they are more
                accurately called GNU/Linux systems.</para>
            <para>GNU has a very particular philosophy, which is central to the
                projects that derive from it, such as Ubuntu. It can be
                essentially summarized as: &quot;Free software is a
                matter of freedom: people should be free to use software in all
                the ways that are socially useful&quot;. &quot;Free
                software&quot; not only means that you shouldn't have to pay
                for it, it also means that you should be able to use the
                software in any way you wish: the code that makes up free
                software is available for anyone to download, change, fix, and
                use in any way. So apart from the fact that free software is
                often available without charge, this freedom also has technical
                advantages: when programs are developed, the hard work of others
                can be used and built upon. With non-free software, this cannot
                happen and when programs are developed, they have to start from
                scratch. For this reason the development of free software is
                fast, efficient and exciting!</para>

                    <title>Version and Release Numbers</title>
                    <para>The Ubuntu version numbering scheme is based on the
                        date we release a version of the distribution. The
                        version number comes from the year and month of the
                        release rather than reflecting the actual version of the
                        software. So, our first release (Warty Warthog) was in
                        October 2004, so its version was 4.10. The next release (&distro-version;), the
                        one for which this document was written, will be in
                        &distro-release-date;, so its version number will be &distro-rev;.</para>
                    <para>Each Ubuntu release has a unique combination of
                        component versions: kernel, X, Gnome, GCC, libc, etc. so
                        an aggregate version number does not make much sense. We
                        prefer to give an idea of <emphasis>when</emphasis> each 
			version was released.</para>

            <para>Working at the command line is not as daunting a task
                as you would think, there is no special knowledge needed to know
                how to use the command line, it is a program like everything
                else. Most things in Linux can be done using the command line,
                although there are graphical tools for most programs, sometimes
                they are just not enough. This is where the command line comes
                in handy.</para>
    	      <para>The <application>Terminal</application> is located in
                    &terminal;, the terminal is often called the command prompt
		    or the shell.  In days gone by, this was the way the
                    user interacted with the computer, however Linux users have
                    found that the use of the shell can be quicker than a
                    graphical method and still holds some merit today. Here you
                    will learn how to use the terminal.</para>
                <para>The original use of the terminal was a file browser and
                    indeed it is still used as a file browser, in the event of
                    the graphical environment failing.  You can use the terminal
                    as a file browser to navigate your files and undo the
                    changes that have been made.</para>

			<title>Root And Sudo</title>
			<para>The root user in GNU/Linux is the user which has administrative access to your system. Normal users do not have this access for security reasons. However, Ubuntu does not include the root user. Instead, administrative access is given to individual users, who may use the "sudo" application to perform administrative tasks. The first user account you created on your system during installation will, by default, have access to sudo. You can restrict and enable sudo access to users with the <application>Users and Groups</application> application (see <xref linkend="users-and-groups"/> for more information).</para>
			<para>When you run an application that requires root privileges, sudo will ask you to input your normal user password. This ensures that rogue applications cannot damage your system, and serves as a reminder that you are about to perform administrative actions which require you to be careful!</para>
			<para>To use sudo when using the command line, simply type "sudo" before the command you wish to run. Sudo will then prompt you for your password.</para>
			<para>Sudo will remember your password for a set amount of time. This feature was designed to allow users to perform multiple administrative tasks without being asked for a password each time.</para>

		<title>Add Applications</title>
			<para>Add Applications is a simple graphical way of installing and removing applications in Ubuntu. To launch Add Applications click
				<menuchoice>
					<guimenu>Applications</guimenu>
					<guimenuitem>Add Applications</guimenuitem>
				</menuchoice> on the desktop menu system.
			</para>
			<para>Running <application>Add Applications</application> requires administrative privileges (see <xref linkend="root-and-sudo"/>).
			</para>
			<para>To install new applications select the category on the left, then check the box of the application you want to install. When finished click <guimenu>Apply</guimenu>, then your chosen programs will be downloaded and installed automatically, as well as installing any additional applications that are required.</para>
			<para>Alternatively, if you know the name of the program you want, use the search tool at the top.</para>
			<note><para>If you have not activated the online package archive, you may be asked to insert your Ubuntu CD-ROM to install some packages.</para></note>
			<para>Some applications and packages are not available to install using <application>Add Programs</application>. If you cannot find the package you are looking for, click <guibutton>Advanced</guibutton> which will open the Synaptic package manager (see below).
			</para>
		</sect2>

	    <sect2 id="synaptic" xreflabel="the Synaptic Package Manager section">
		<title>Synaptic</title>
			<para>Synaptic is an advanced package management application that can install and remove every package available to your system. The interface is graphical but a lot more information is presented to the user, however this means that Synaptic gives you complete control over the package management of your system.
To launch Synaptic, choose 
				<menuchoice>
					<guimenu>System</guimenu>
					<guisubmenu>Administration</guisubmenu>
					<guimenuitem>Synaptic Package Manager</guimenuitem>
				</menuchoice> on the desktop menu system.
			</para>
			<para>The Synaptic screen is divided up into four sections, the two most important being the package categories on the left side, and the packages on the right. To install packages, just choose the category, find the package name in the list, right click on it and choose "Mark this package for installation". Once you are satisfied with your selections click <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> on the top menu bar. Synaptic will then download and install the required packages from the online repositories and/or from your Ubuntu installation CD.
			</para>
			<para>Alternatively you can click the Search tool bar button, enter the package name in the search text field and click the Search button. Synaptic will now show you a much shorter list from which to select your application for installation. This can be much easier than having to look through the very long list of applications on your own.

		<title>Extra Repositories</title>
			<sect3><title>What are Repositories?</title>
			<para>There are thousands of programs available to install on Ubuntu. These programs are stored in software archives (repositories) and are made freely available for installation over the Internet. This makes it very easy to install new programs in Linux, and it is also very secure, because each program you install is built specially for Ubuntu and checked before it is installed. To organise the software, Ubuntu repositories are categorised into four groups.
			</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>Main</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Restricted</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Universe</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Multiverse</para></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			<para>These four groups of software are also known as "components." The rational used to determine which software goes into which category, or component, is based on two factors:
			</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>The level of support software development teams are prepared to provide for a program.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>The level of compliance the program has to the <ulink url="&ubuntu-philosophy;">Free Software Philosophy</ulink>.</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			<para>The standard Ubuntu Install CD contains a subset of software available from the "main" and "restricted" categories. Once your system is made aware of the Internet-based locations for these repositories, many more software programs are made available for installation. Using the software package management tools already installed on your system, you can search for, install and update any piece of software directly over the Internet, without the need for physical installation media.</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3><title>Adding Extra Repositories</title>
			<para>To enable the extra repositories, first launch Synaptic by choosing
				<menuchoice>
					<guimenu>System</guimenu>
					<guisubmenu>Administration</guisubmenu>
					<guimenuitem>Synaptic Package Manager</guimenuitem>
				</menuchoice> on the desktop menu system. After you type in your password and Synaptic starts:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Choose 
						<menuchoice>
							<guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
							<guimenuitem>Repositories</guimenuitem>
						</menuchoice> from the top menu bar in Synaptic, a list of repositories will appear. Click the Settings button at the bottom and tick Show disabled software sources. Then click the Close button. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><para>Back on the list of repositories, checkboxes will appear next to each one. Simply tick each check box to enable the corresponding repository.  Once you have enabled the repositories, click <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to save your settings.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><para>Back in the main Synaptic window, update your list of available packages by clicking <guibutton>Reload</guibutton> on the top menu bar. Once you have updated your package lists, many more packages will be available for installation.</para>

	    <sect2 id="updates" xreflabel="the Update Ubuntu section">
		<title>Updates</title>
			<para>Sometimes the Ubuntu developers release feature and security updates for applications and packages within the Ubuntu system. When these updates are available, Ubuntu will inform you with a pop-up from your notification area. When you see this pop-up, click <guibutton>Show Updates</guibutton>, enter your password and click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. The Ubuntu Update manager will list the available updates: to download and install these updates click <guibutton>Install</guibutton>. Ubuntu will then download and install the available updates from the Internet.  When Ubuntu Update manager has finished updating your system, click <guibutton>Close</guibutton>, then close Ubuntu Update Manager to finish updating your system.
