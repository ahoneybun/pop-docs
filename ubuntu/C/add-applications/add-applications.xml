		<title>What is a package manager?</title>
		<para>To add or remove applications in Ubuntu, you need to use a <emphasis>package manager</emphasis>. This is a program that installs and uninstalls software, and keeps track of all the components each piece of software needs.
		</para>
		<para>There are three main package managers you can use in Ubuntu:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para><link linkend="gnome-app-install"><application>Add/Remove Programs</application></link> - The easiest way to install and uninstall programs.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para><link linkend="synaptic"><application>Synaptic</application></link> - Advanced control of software and other system components.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para><link linkend="apt"><application>Apt</application></link> - For if you prefer using the Terminal.</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>If you open more than one of these programs at once, they may not work. Close them all and open just one.</para>
		<para>You need administrative access to use any of these programs.</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para><xref linkend="root-and-sudo" /></para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</section>
  <section id="gnome-app-install" status="complete">
		<title>Add/Remove Applications</title>
		<para>With the <guimenuitem>Add/Remove&#8230;</guimenuitem> item in the <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> menu, you can install programs to do new things with Ubuntu. You can also remove programs you don&#8217;t want. You need administrative access to use <application>Add/Remove Programs</application>.</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para><xref linkend="root-and-sudo" /></para></listitem>

		<para>If you know the name of a program you want to install, enter it in the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> field. Otherwise, begin by choosing a software category on the left.</para>
		<para>Programs that are already installed begin with a check mark next to their name. Uncheck a program if you want to remove it from your computer.</para>
		<para>When you click <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> or <guibutton>OK</guibutton>, any new software will be downloaded from the Internet, and Ubuntu will make the changes you selected. If you have not activated the online package archive, you may be asked to insert your Ubuntu CD-ROM to install some packages.</para>
		<para>Some software cannot be installed or removed using <application>Add/Remove Applications</application>. If you cannot find the package you are looking for, click <guibutton>Advanced</guibutton> to open Synaptic.
		</para>

	<section id="synaptic" status="complete">
		<title>Synaptic Package Manager</title>
		<para><application>Synaptic</application> is an advanced package management application that can install and remove every package available to your system. The interface is graphical like <application>Add/Remove Applications</application>, but presents much more information and gives you complete control over the software on your computer.</para>
		<para>To launch <application>Synaptic</application>, from the <guimenu>System</guimenu> menu choose  
			<menuchoice>
				<guisubmenu>Administration</guisubmenu>

			<listitem><para><xref linkend="root-and-sudo" /></para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>If you know the name of the package you want to install or remove, click the <guibutton>Search</guibutton> button, and enter the package name or a short search term. You can also search for packages by description (for example, you can find all packages mentioning <quote><wordasword>arcade</wordasword></quote> or <quote><wordasword>mathematics</wordasword></quote>).</para>
		<para>Use the categories on the left to filter the list of packages. To return to the list of categories after doing a search, click <guibutton>Sections</guibutton>.</para>
		<para>To install a package, click the box next to it and choose <guimenuitem>Mark for installation</guimenuitem>. If you change your mind, choose <guimenuitem>Unmark</guimenuitem>. To remove a package that is already installed, choose <guimenuitem>Mark for Removal</guimenuitem>.</para>
		<para>When you&#8217;ve finished, click <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> and Ubuntu will make the changes you selected. If you don&#8217;t want to make any changes, close the window instead.</para>

	<section id="install-file" status="complete">
		<title>Installing a Single Package File</title>
		<para>The preferred method of installing programs is via the package managers described in this chapter. However, although the Ubuntu package archives are very large, it is possible that you may wish to install a package that is not available in the Ubuntu archives. If this happens, you can also download and install files from websites.</para>
					<caution>
						<para>It is important to ensure that any files you download come from a safe source before installing them.
						</para>
					</caution>
		<para>There are many different kinds of Linux package files. Most of these are associated with the package managers of specific Linux distributions. Examples are <emphasis>Debian Package</emphasis> files (<emphasis>.deb</emphasis> files), <emphasis>RPM Package Manager</emphasis> files (<emphasis>.rpm</emphasis> files), and <emphasis>Tarballs</emphasis> (<emphasis>.tar</emphasis> files).</para>
		<para>This section deals with installing these single files.</para>
		<warning><para>It is not guaranteed that these files will be compatible with your system and you will not receive security updates if you install these files. For these reasons, if you wish to install a program, always use a native Ubuntu package of the application available through a package manager, if there is one available.</para></warning>

		<section id="install-deb" status="complete">
			<title>Install/uninstall <emphasis>.deb</emphasis> files</title>
					<para>These files are <emphasis>Debian packages</emphasis>. The package files associated with Ubuntu have the <emphasis>.deb</emphasis> suffix because of Ubuntu's close relations with the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. You will need administrative privileges to install a <emphasis>.deb</emphasis> file (see <xref linkend="root-and-sudo"/>).
					</para>
						<para>To install a <emphasis>.deb</emphasis> file, double-click on it. If you prefer using the Terminal, enter:
						<screen>sudo dpkg -i package_file.deb</screen>
						</para>
						<para>To uninstall a <emphasis>.deb</emphasis> file, deselect it in your package manager. Or from a Terminal, enter:
						<screen>sudo dpkg -r package_name</screen>
						</para>
		</section>
		<section id="alien" status="complete">
			<title>Convert <emphasis>.rpm</emphasis> files to <emphasis>.deb</emphasis> files</title>
					<para>Another type of package files is <emphasis>Red Hat Package Manager</emphasis> files which have the <emphasis>.rpm</emphasis> suffix. It is not recommended to install these on an Ubuntu system. In almost all cases, a native Ubuntu <emphasis>.deb</emphasis> package is available. However, if absolutely necessary, an <emphasis>.rpm</emphasis> file can be converted to a <emphasis>.deb</emphasis> package using the program <application>alien</application>.
					</para>
						<para>
							In a terminal, enter:
							<screen>sudo alien <emphasis>package_file.rpm</emphasis></screen>
						</para>
						<para>
							If you get a <quote>command not found</quote> or similar error, install <application>alien</application> before trying again:
							<screen>sudo apt-get install alien</screen>
							<!-- No point in pointing to the generic "How to install
							programs" section, because alien is command-line only anyway. -->
						</para>
			</section>
			<section id="tarballs" status="complete">
				<title>Install <emphasis>tarballs</emphasis></title>
					<para>Files with the <emphasis>.tar.gz</emphasis> or <emphasis>.tar.bz2</emphasis> suffix are package files known as <emphasis>tarballs</emphasis> which are widely used in Linux and Unix.</para>
					<para>If there is no native Ubuntu package available in any of the Ubuntu repositories, you can use the command line to install or uninstall the Tarball file by following the instructions that come with the package.</para>
					<para>Tarballs often contain the source code of the program, and need to be <emphasis>compiled</emphasis> in order to be used. To do this, extra software will generally be needed (see <xref linkend="build-essential"/>).</para>

	    <section id="extra-repositories" status="complete">
		<title>Software Repositories</title>
			<section status="review"><title>What are Repositories?</title>
			<para>There are thousands of programs available to install on Ubuntu. These programs are stored in software archives (<emphasis>repositories</emphasis>) and are made freely available for installation over the Internet. This makes it very easy to install new programs in Linux, and it is also very secure, because each program you install is built specially for Ubuntu and checked before it is installed. To organise the software, Ubuntu repositories are categorised into four groups: <emphasis>Main</emphasis>, <emphasis>Restricted</emphasis>, <emphasis>Universe</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Multiverse</emphasis>.</para> 
			<para>The rationale used to determine which software goes into which category is based on two factors:</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>The level of support software development teams provide for a program.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>The level of compliance the program has to the <ulink url="&ubuntu-philosophy;">Free Software Philosophy</ulink>.</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			<para>You can find more information about the Repositories available <ulink url="&ubuntu-components;">on the website</ulink>.</para>
			<para>The standard Ubuntu Install CD contains some software from the <emphasis>Main</emphasis> and <emphasis>Restricted</emphasis> categories. Once your system is made aware of the Internet-based locations for these repositories, many more software programs are made available for installation. Using the software package management tools already installed on your system, you can search for, install and update any piece of software directly over the Internet, without the need for the CD.</para>

		<section status="complete">
			<title>Adding Extra Repositories</title>
			<para>To install software from the <quote>Universe</quote> or <quote>Multiverse</quote> repositories:</para>
			<procedure>
				<step>
					<para>Open &software-properties;.</para>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>To use the <quote>Universe</quote> repository, turn on <guilabel>Community Maintained Open Source software (Universe)</guilabel>.</para>
					<note>
						<para>Adding this repository will mean that the majority of the Free Software universe will be available to install on your system. This software is supported by a carefully selected group of volunteers within the Ubuntu Community, but is not supported by the core Ubuntu development team and may not include security updates.</para>
					</note>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>To use the <quote>Multiverse</quote> repository, turn on <guilabel>By copyright or legal issues restricted software (Multiverse)</guilabel>.</para>
					<warning>
						<para>Adding this repository will mean that software which has been classified as <emphasis>non-free</emphasis> will be available to install on your system. This software may not be permitted in some jurisdictions. When installing each package from this repository, you should verify that the laws of your country permit you to use it. Again, this software may not include security updates.</para>
					</warning>
				</step>
				<step><para>Click <guibutton>Close</guibutton> to save your changes.</para>
				</step>
				<step><para>Click <guibutton>Reload</guibutton> to update the list of available packages.</para>
				</step>
			</procedure>

		</section>
	    <section id="updates" status="complete">
		<title>Updates</title>
			<para>Sometimes the Ubuntu developers release feature and security updates for applications and packages within the Ubuntu system.
			</para>
			<para>When these updates are available, Ubuntu will inform you with a pop-up and a red icon in your notification area. To update your system, click the red button, enter your password and click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.
			</para>
			<para>The <application>Update Manager</application> program will list the available updates: to download and install these updates click <guibutton>Install Updates</guibutton>. Ubuntu will then download and install the available updates from the Internet.
			</para>
			<para>When <application>Update Manager</application> has finished updating your system, close the pop-up window with the <guibutton>Close</guibutton> button, then close <application>Update Manager</application> to finish updating your system. 
			</para>
			<note>
				<para>After installing some important updates, it may be necessary to restart your computer. If so, Ubuntu will inform you with a popup and an icon in your notification area.
