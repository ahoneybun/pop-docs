							<para>Ubuntu is a South African ethical ideology focusing on
                        people&apos;s allegiances and relations with each other. The
                        word comes from the Zulu and Xhosa languages. Ubuntu
                        (pronounced &quot;oo-BOON-too&quot;) is seen as a
                        traditional African concept, is regarded as one of the
                        founding principles of the new republic of South Africa
                        and is connected to the idea of an African Renaissance.
							</para>
							<para>A rough translation of the principle of Ubuntu is
                        &quot;humanity towards others&quot;. Another
                        translation could be: &quot;the belief in a
                        universal bond of sharing that connects all
                        humanity&quot;.

                    		<para>The Ubuntu project is entirely committed to the
                        principles of open source software development; people
                        are encouraged to use open source software, improve it,
                        and pass it on. This means that Ubuntu is and will
                        always be free of charge.
								</para>
                    <para>However, this means more than just being available at zero cost. The philosophy of free software is that people should be free to use software in all the ways that are &quot;socially useful&quot;. &quot;Free software&quot; doesn't just mean that you shouldn&apos;t have to pay for it, it also means that you should be able to use the software in any way you wish: the code that makes up free software is available for anyone to download, change, fix, and use in any way. So apart from the fact that free software is often available without charge, this freedom also has technical advantages: when programs are developed, the hard work of others can be used and built upon. With non-free software, this cannot happen and when programs are developed, they have to start from scratch. For this reason the development of free software is fast, efficient and exciting!

                    	<para>There are many different operating systems based on GNU/Linux:
 	                 Debian, SuSE, Gentoo, RedHat, and Mandriva are examples. 
			   Ubuntu is yet another contender in what
                        is already a highly competitive world. So what makes
                        Ubuntu different?
							</para>
                    	<para>Based on Debian, one of the most widely acclaimed,
                        technologically advanced, and well-supported
                        distributions, Ubuntu
                        aims to create a distribution that provides
                        an up-to-date and coherent Linux system for desktop and
                        server computing. Ubuntu includes a number of carefully
                        selected packages from the Debian distribution and
                        retains its powerful package management system which
                        allows easy installation and clean removal of programs. Unlike most
                        distributions that ship with a large amount of software
                        that may or may not be of use, Ubuntu&apos;s list of packages
                        is reduced to a number of important applications of high
                        quality.
							</para>
                    	<para>By focusing on quality, Ubuntu produces a robust and

                        use in both home and commercial environments. The
                        project takes the time required to focus on finer
                        details and is able to release a version featuring the
                        latest and greatest of today&apos;s software once every 6
                        months. Ubuntu is available in flavours for the i386
                        (386/486/Pentium(II/III/IV) and Athlon/Duron/Sempron
                        processors), AMD64 (Athlon64, Opteron, and new 64-bit
                        Intel processors), and PowerPC (iBook/Powerbook, G4 and
