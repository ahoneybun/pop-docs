"In Ubuntu, for security reasons, administrative tasks are confined to users "

"administrative tasks. The first user account you created on your system "
"during installation will, by default, have access to sudo. You can restrict "
"and enable sudo access to users with the <application>Users and "
"Groups</application> application (see <ulink type=\"help\" "
