msgid "Because each partition is treated as a separate device, each partition must be <emphasis>formatted</emphasis> with a <emphasis>filesystem</emphasis>. Formatting is the process of creating a filesystem on a partition. A filesystem is a method which an operating system uses to store your files - there are many different filesystems, each with its own advantages and limitations. Common filesystems used in a dual boot system include NTFS, FAT32, and ext3. NTFS, to which Linux cannot safely write data, is the default filesystem used by Windows. Ubuntu treats this filesystem as read-only. ext3 is a native Linux filesystem that can be accessed from Windows using various tools such as ext2fs. FAT32 (also know as vfat) is a filesystem to which Linux can write safely. Hence, in a dual system, a FAT32 filesystem is commonly used as a way of sharing files between Linux and Windows."
