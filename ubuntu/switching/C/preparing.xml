	<title>Preparing to switch</title>
	<para>While using Windows you will have probably stored a great deal of data, including documents, emails and music. You will probably want to keep most of this for use with &ubuntu; after you have switched. This section provides instructions on how to prepare yourself and your data for making the switch.</para>
	<sect1 id="preparing-trying">
		<title>Trying-out &ubuntu;</title>
		<para>It is possible to try &ubuntu; before installation. This is a good idea, as it helps you to get a feel for &ubuntu; and will allow you to explore some of its features.</para>

	<sect1 id="preparing-hardware">
		<title>Hardware compatibility</title>
		<para>&ubuntu; offers support for a great deal of computer hardware and will run on most computers. However, some devices are currently unsupported and so cannot yet be used in &ubuntu;. It is important to check that your hardware will work after you have made the switch.</para>
		<sect2 id="preparing-hardware-checking">
			<title>Checking hardware compatibility</title>
			<para>Make a list of all of the devices connected to your computer, visit the wiki and then check them off if they work or not. If you cant find a device on the wiki, try a web search to see if someone has used the device successfully in the past. If you still dont know, try the Live CD. Ask on the forums. Installing &ubuntu; is the only way of being absolutely sure whether your device works or not. It is possible that, after installation, your device does not work. However, it may be possible to get it to work by installing additional software. Instructions on getting many devices to work are available on the wiki.</para>

			<title>Problematic devices</title>
			<para>Certain types of devices are poorly supported by &ubuntu; for various reasons. If you have such a device, it will probably be difficult or impossible to get it to work under &ubuntu;. Below is a list of poorly-supported device types:</para>

		<title>Organising your files</title>
		<para>A good way of making sure that your data is safe and ready to be used in &ubuntu; is to organise your files before you make the switch.</para>

			<title>General file organisation</title>
			<para>Of all of the data on your computer, a sizeable portion is likely to be <emphasis>redundant</emphasis>. That is, it is data which you will never need to use again, and there is no value in saving it for posterity. Before switching to &ubuntu;, it is a good idea to identify and remove this redundant data. This has the advantage of reducing the amount of data which you must copy across from your Windows installation to your new &ubuntu; installation.</para>
			<para>If your data is organised neatly, back-up and retrieval of that data when you make the switch will be much simplified. It is worth spending a little time organising your data into one location, with different directories for different files and folders. If you have a tidy collection of documents, you are less likely to forget an important document when making the switch.</para>
			<para>It is recommended that you move all of the files you wish to save into your <filename>My Documents</filename> directory. This way, everything you need is in one location rather than being spread across multiple directories.</para>
			<para>There are many tools available to help you to organise your data and to remove unused files. Windows XP has a built-in tool to help you to clean-up your files.

		<title>Converting unsupported file types</title>
		<para>While applications available for &ubuntu; support most common file types, there are still many file types which are not supported. If you have files in an unsupported format, it is recommended that you try to convert them to a supported format before switching. This section covers some common, unsupported or only partially-supported file types and lists the alternatives and methods of conversion.</para>

				<listitem><para><emphasis role='strong'>Many common audio formats cannot be played on &ubuntu; without the installation of additional software. This is due to legal restrictions.</emphasis></para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Unfortunately, due to legal restrictions and technical issues with many common audio formats, &ubuntu; cannot play some audio formats out-of-the-box. While support for some restricted formats can be added at a later date, it can be advantageous to convert audio files to a well-supported format. This is especially important if the files have been encoded using some form of <emphasis>Digital Rights Management (DRM)</emphasis> software, as DRM restrictions can render files unplayable in all applications but the one in which they were applied.</para>
			<para>The following major audio formats are proprietary and so are not supported by default in &ubuntu;:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>MP3</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>WMA</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>AAC</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>RealAudio</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>For a well-supported audio format to replace MP3 and WMA, consider the <emphasis>Ogg Vorbis</emphasis> format. For a well-supported lossless (very high quality) format to replace AAC Lossless and WMA-VBR, consider the <emphasis>FLAC</emphasis> format. Both of these formats are open, and can be played in &ubuntu; without the installation of any additional software.</para>
			<para>There are many audio conversion applications for Windows available for download, and some of these can be obtained free of charge. These applications are also sometimes referred to as <emphasis>audio (re)encoders</emphasis>. Your choice of application depends on the formats which you wish to convert from and to. See websites such as <ulink url="http://www.download.com/Rippers-Encoders/3150-2140_4-0.html?tag=dir">Download.com</ulink> for a list of potentially useful applications.</para>
			<para>It is still possible to add support for many restricted formats (such as those listed above) to &ubuntu; after installation. See the <ulink url="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats">Restricted Formats</ulink> document on-line for more information.</para>

			</itemizedlist>
			<para>As with audio formats, due to legal and technical issues, many video formats are not supported by the default &ubuntu; install. While support for some formats can be added at a later date, it is recommended that you convert important video files in unsupported formats to a format which is well supported in &ubuntu;.</para>
			<para>As with the audio formats, there are many video convertor applications available as free-of-charge downloads for Windows. Consider converting your video files to a format which is well-supported by &ubuntu;, such as <emphasis>Ogg Theora</emphasis>.</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para><emphasis role='strong'>&ubuntu; office applications can read most common office document formats without the need for conversion</emphasis></para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>The default office suite of &ubuntu;, <application>OpenOffice.org</application>, supports very many office document formats right out of the box. These include many of the Microsoft Office, Corel and Lotus formats. If you find that you do have files in formats which are unsupported, it is likely that your existing office suite or application will have the ability to save the files to a better-supported format.</para>
			<para>The OpenDocument file formats are gaining popularity and are expected to become the de facto supported office formats for Ubuntu. While many older applications cannot save to OpenDocument format, other formats such as .doc and RTF are also well supported.</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para><emphasis role='strong'>Some file formats are specific to particular Windows-only applications, and so cannot be used with &ubuntu; software</emphasis></para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Many applications use file formats specific to them. A good example is the <application>Adobe Photoshop</application> file format. These formats are generally able to store more data than widely-used standard formats and so are still useful. You may find that applications exist on &ubuntu; to convert or use application specific formats. <application>The GIMP</application> is able to use Adobe PSD files, for example.</para>

		<title>Transferring your data safely</title>
		<para>Once you have collected together all of the files and settings you might need, you must create a copy of them which can be stored safely while you initially install &ubuntu;. There are many ways of storing a copy of this data, and which method you choose will depend on your particular circumstances.</para>
		<caution>
			<para>After you have made a copy of your files, it is very important to <emphasis role='strong'>test the files</emphasis> to ensure that they have been copied successfully. If you have many files, at least check the most important files and randomly check other files where possible. This will help to protect you from data loss.</para>
		</caution>
		<sect2 id="preparing-storage-direct">
			<title>Direct transfer</title>
			<para>If you are installing &ubuntu; onto a different computer than the one on which your data is stored, you can leave the data you collected on that computer and can safely transfer the data across once &ubuntu; has been installed onto the other computer.</para>
			<para>When ready, you can transfer the data between the computers using a network connection.</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="preparing-storage-cddvd">
			<title>CD or DVD disc</title>
			<para>A common and reliable way of backing-up data is by using a recordable CD or DVD disc. CDs and DVDs can be used by almost all computers and are relatively cheap. However, your computer must have a CD or DVD recorder drive installed and you may have to use several CDs or DVDs if the data you have collected is larger than the capacity of a single disc.</para>
			<para>If possible, use DVD discs as these have a larger capacity and so you will require fewer discs to store all of your data. CDs typically have a capacity of 650-700MB while DVDs can normally hold up to 4.5GB of data (roughly equivalent to 7 CDs).</para>
			<para>In order to store data on a blank CD or DVD, you must use a <emphasis>CD writing</emphasis> application. Microsoft Windows XP includes such an application by default, although other such applications are capable of storing your data just as well.</para>

				<listitem><para>Follow the instructions given on-screen by the <application>CD Writing Wizard</application>. This will write the selected files to a blank CD or DVD.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Once the disc has been written, eject it and then re-insert it into the drive. In <filename>My Computer</filename>, open the drive and check that the files you just copied to the CD are visible there. Try opening a few of them just to make sure.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Repeat this procedure until all of the files you collected together are safely stored onto CDs or DVDs.</para></listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>Once you have stored your data onto discs, ensure that the discs are well protected and labelled correctly. If you scratch or otherwise damage a disc, you may lose some of the data stored on it. Labelling discs also helps to avoid confusion and will allow you to quickly find data when the time comes to tranfer it back onto a computer.</para>

			<title>External hard-disk drive or other removable device</title>
			<para>If you have access to an external hard-disk drive or some other removable storage device of a great enough capacity, then you can simply copy the files you have collected onto this device. When ready to transfer the files onto your &ubuntu; installation, you may simply connect the drive and copy the files from it again.</para>
			<para>Removable storage devices such as external hard disks will have a certain type of <emphasis>file system</emphasis>. For use on removable devices, the best supported filesystem for &ubuntu; is <emphasis>FAT</emphasis> (also called <emphasis>FAT32</emphasis> or <emphasis>vfat</emphasis>). While other file systems (such as NTFS and HFS+) are usable, they may require additional steps to allow you to use them with &ubuntu;. If possible, try to use the FAT format for your removable disk.</para>
			<para>You can discover the format of an external disk by right-clicking it in <filename>My Computer</filename> and selecting <guilabel>Properties</guilabel>. The format of the disk is shown in the <guilabel>General</guilabel> tab under <guilabel>File system</guilabel>.</para>
