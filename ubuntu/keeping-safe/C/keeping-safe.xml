			<title>Using separate users</title>
			<para>During installation of Ubuntu, a single user and password is created. However, in order to keep your computer and documents safe, it is important to use a separate user account for each person that uses the computer. In this way, multiple users can have access to the computer while preserving and protecting their own personal settings and files.</para>
			<para>On Ubuntu, each user has their own <emphasis>home directory</emphasis> in which files and settings are stored. Furthermore, each user can be part of one or more <emphasis>groups</emphasis>, which define which parts of the system that user has access to.</para>
			
			<note>
				<para>You may need administrative rights to make some of the changes detailed below. See <ulink type="help" url="ghelp:administrative">Administrative tasks</ulink> for more information.</para>

				<title>Managing users</title>
				<para>To modify the users or groups on your system, you can use the <application>Users And Groups</application> application located in &users-groups;.</para>
				<para>To add a new user, click on <guilabel>Add user</guilabel>, enter the required information and then click <guilabel>OK</guilabel>.</para>
				<para>To edit the properties of each user, select a user and then click the <guilabel>Properties</guilabel> button located in the <guilabel>Users settings</guilabel> window.</para>
				<para>To give a new user administrative rights (see <ulink type="help" url="ghelp:administrative">Administrative Tasks</ulink>), edit that user's properties and, under the <guilabel>User Privileges</guilabel> tab, ensure that the <guilabel>Administer the system</guilabel> box is checked.</para>

				<title>Managing groups of users</title>
				<para>To add a new group, in the <guilabel>User settings</guilabel> window, choose <guibutton>Manage Groups</guibutton> and then click <guilabel>Add group</guilabel>.

If you try to allocate a <guilabel>Group ID</guilabel> that is in use, the system will warn you.</para>
				<para>You can add users to the newly created group by selecting a user by checking the box of the user in the <guilabel>Group Members</guilabel> list. Removing a user is as simple as adding one: deselect the box left to the name. When you are ready, click <guilabel>OK</guilabel> and the new group with its users, if inserted, will be created.</para>

			<title>Avoid Internet nuisances and crime</title>
				<para>From time to time, you may be sent an email which carries a virus or links to a fraudulent website. This type of email is very common, and it is important to learn how to deal with it, in order to prevent your computer or your personal details from being compromised or misused.</para>
				<para>Such messages are often received from total strangers. However, sometimes an email may appear to be from someone you know, when really it is not. This is because it is possible to include a fake sender email address in emails.</para>
				<para>Unwanted (unsolicited) mail tends to fall in to one of several categories:</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>Spam (junk) email, where people offer unwanted services and products</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Scam emails, where people pretend to ask for help in exchange for large sums of money</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Phishing email, where the message appears to be from a bank or other online service, asking you to enter your personal and financial details, or passwords.</para></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				
				<para>Below are some tips for keeping safe online:</para>
				
				<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>You should never reply to unsolicited mail, or even click on the links in the mail. Doing so usually results in more junk mail being sent to you.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Never click on links in emails which lead to websites asking for your password or similar. It is possible for the text of the link to give one address, when really it opens up another (possibly dangerous) address. Instead, type the link into your web browser yourself and proceed from there.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>If a website asks for your financial details, ensure that it is secure. In the <application>Firefox Web browser</application>, secure websites have a <emphasis>yellow</emphasis> address bar with a padlock icon to the right of the address. Click on the padlock to read more information about the security of the website.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Only download and run software from sources that you trust. By default, you can only download software directly from Ubuntu.</para></listitem>

		<sect1 id="backup-files" status="review">
			<title>Make backup copies of your files</title>
				<para>A problem which you may occasionally encounter is the unexpected loss of some of your work and settings for one reason or another. The causes of such <emphasis>data loss</emphasis> are many and varied; it could be anything from a power cut to accidentally deleting a file. It is highly recommended that you make regular back-up copies of your important files so that, if you do encounter a problem, you will not have lost those files.</para>
				
				<para>It is wise to store back-up copies of files separately from your computer; that is, you should make use of some form of file storage which is not permanently attached to your computer. Options include:</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>Writable CDs and DVDs</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>External hard disks and flash memory devices</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Another computer on the network</para></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				
				<para>A simple way of backing-up your files is to manually copy them to a safe location (see above) by using the <application>File Browser</application>.</para>
				<para>Alternatively, you can use a dedicated back-up application, such as <application>HUBackup</application>:</para>
				
				<procedure>
				<step>
					<para>Install the <application>hubackup</application> package from the <quote>Universe</quote> repository (see <ulink type="help" url="ghelp:add-applications">Add Applications</ulink>).</para>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>To make a backup, press <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu><guisubmenu>Administration</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Home User Backup</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
					</para>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>Select the files which you would like to make a backup copy of and choose the location which you would like to save the backup to. If you have a CD or DVD writer, it should be present in this list.</para>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>Press <guibutton>Backup</guibutton> and follow the instructions given on-screen.</para>
				</step>
			</procedure>
			<para>To restore a backup made with <application>HUBackup</application>, press <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu><guisubmenu>Administration</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Home User Restore</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and follow the instrctions on-screen.</para>
				
				<para>Some general advice on how to keep good back-ups is given below:</para>

					<listitem><para>Always test your back-ups after you make them, to ensure that they have been made correctly</para></listitem>
