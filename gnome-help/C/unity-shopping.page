  <title>Why are there shopping links in the Dash?</title>

<p>In addition to helping you find apps or files on your computer, the 
<gui>Dash</gui> can also show you related online results for your searches. 
Online sources include Amazon.com and dozens of other online sources.</p>

<p>When you purchase music or products from these sources, Canonical 
receives a small portion of the profits in exchange for directing more 
business to these stores. Canonical, the company that created and 
continues to support the Ubuntu project, then uses this money to make 
Ubuntu better.</p>

<p>By default, the inclusion of online search results is turned off. 
If you want to include online search results, you can 
  enable this feature through the <link xref="security-settings"><gui>Security &amp; Privacy</gui></link> settings.</p>
