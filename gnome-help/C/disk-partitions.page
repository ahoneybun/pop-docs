 <title>Manage volumes and partitions</title>

  <p>The word <em>volume</em> is used to describe a storage device, like a hard
 disk. It can also refer to a <em>part</em> of the storage on that device,
 because you can split the storage up into chunks. The computer makes this
 storage accessible via your file system in a process referred to as
 <em>mounting</em>. Mounted volumes may be hard drives, USB drives, DVD-RWs, SD
 cards, and other media. If a volume is currently mounted, you can read (and
 possibly write) files on it.</p>

  <p>Often, a mounted volume is called a <em>partition</em>, though they are not
 necessarily the same thing. A “partition” refers to a <em>physical</em> area of
 storage on a single disk drive. Once a partition has been mounted, it can be
 referred to as a volume because you can access the files on it. You can think
 of volumes as the labeled, accessible “storefronts” to the functional “back
 rooms” of partitions and drives.</p>

 <title>View and manage volumes and partitions</title>

  <p>To view and manage your computer's volumes and partitions:</p>

<steps>
 <item>
  <p>Open <app>Disks</app> from the <gui>Dash</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p> In the left pane, you will find a list of hard disks,
  CD/DVD drives, other physical devices, and loop devices. Select the device that you want to
  inspect.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p> In the right pane, the area labeled <gui>Volumes</gui> provides a visual
  breakdown of the volumes and partitions (if any) present on the selected device. It
  also contains a variety of tools used to manage these volumes.</p>

  <p>Be careful: it is possible to completely erase the data on your disk with
  these tools.</p>

 </item>
</steps>

  <p>Your computer most likely has at least one <em>primary</em> partition and a
 single <em>swap</em> partition. The swap partition is used by the operating
 system for memory management, and is rarely mounted.  The primary partition
 contains your operating system, applications, settings, and personal files.
 These files can also be distributed among multiple partitions for security or
 convenience.</p>

  <p>One primary partition must contain information that your computer uses to
 start up, or <em>boot</em>. For this reason it is sometimes called a boot
 partition, or boot volume. If a volume is bootable, the information displayed will say: "Partition Type ... (Bootable)".
 External media such as USB flash drives and CDs may also contain a bootable volume.</p>
