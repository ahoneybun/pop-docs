    <title>Introducing Ubuntu</title>
    <para>Thank you for your interest in Ubuntu Linux &distro-rev; -- our &distro-version; release.</para>
    <para id="about1">Ubuntu Linux is an entirely open source operating system built around the Linux kernel.
    The Ubuntu community is comprised of developers, programmers, testers, techwriters, documentation testers, translators, and most importantly, the people who use Ubuntu every day.
    We invite you to join this community and help make Ubuntu the operating system you, your family, your friends, and your colleages will love to use.
    Help us translate Ubuntu into your language, try it on new and unusual hardware, improve the experience of other users with hints, tips, and FAQs, or help to shape the direction Ubuntu is headed by providing feedback about the software you love most.</para>
    <para id="about2">The Ubuntu community is built around the ideals enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto:
        that software should be available free of charge, that software tools should be usable by
        people in their local language and despite any disabilities, and that people should have the
        freedom to customize and alter their software in whatever way they see fit. For those
        reasons: <itemizedlist>

            <title>About the Name</title>
            <para>On hearing the name &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, many people are curious about the
                meaning of the word.</para>
            <para>Ubuntu is a South African ethic ideology focusing on people's allegiances and
                relations with each other. The word comes from the Zulu and Xhosa languages. Ubuntu,
                pronounced &quot;oo-BOON-too,&quot; is seen as a traditional African concept
                and is held as one of the founding principles of the new republic of South Africa
                and connected to the idea of an African Renaissance.</para>
            <para>A rough translation of Ubuntu's principles could be &quot;humanity towards
                others.&quot; Another translation could be: &quot;The belief in a universal
                bond of sharing that connects all humanity.&quot;</para>
            <para>&quot;A person with ubuntu is open and available to others, affirming of
                others, does not feel threatened that others are able and good, for he or she has a
                proper self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or she belongs in a greater
                whole and is diminished when others are humiliated or diminished, when others are
                tortured or oppressed.&quot; <emphasis>-- Archbishop Desmond Tutu</emphasis>.</para>
            <para>As a platform based on GNU/Linux, the Ubuntu distribution brings the spirit of
                Ubuntu to the software world.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2 id="sect-ubuntu-difference" status="complete">
            <title>The Difference</title>
            <para>There are many GNU/Linux distributions in the world, some are built from the
                ground up and some are based on others; each has aimed to perfect the platform and
                its desktop. However, only a few survive, with names such as Debian, SuSE, Gentoo,
                RedHat, and Mandrake being the most notable.</para>
            <para>Based on Debian, one of the most widely acclaimed, technologically advanced, and
                well-supported distributions, Ubuntu is yet another contender in what is already a
                highly competitive world. So what makes Ubuntu different?</para>
            <para>With its solid and advanced Debian foundation, Ubuntu aims to create a
                Debian-based distribution that provides an up-to-date and coherent Linux system for
                desktop and server computing. Ubuntu includes a number of carefully selected packages
                from the Debian distribution and retains its powerful package management system
                which allows easy installation and clean removal of programs, as well as
                automatically handling any dependencies programs may have on each other. Unlike most
                distributions that ship with a large amount of software that may or may not be of
                use, Ubuntu's list of packages is reduced to a number of important applications
                of high quality.</para>
            <para>By focusing on quality, Ubuntu produces a robust and feature-rich computing
                environment that is suitable for use in both home and commercial environments. The
                project takes the time required to focus on finer details and is able to release a
                version featuring the latest and greatest of today's software once every 6 months.
                Ubuntu is available in flavours for the
                i386 (386/486/Pentium(II/III/IV) and Athlon/Duron/Sempron processors),
                AMD64 (Athlon64, Opteron, and new 64-bit Intel processors),
                and PowerPC (iBook/Powerbook, G4 and G5)
                architectures.</para>

        <sect2 id="sect-ubuntu-desktop" status="complete">
            <title>The Desktop</title>
            <para>The default desktop environment for Ubuntu is <ulink url="&gnome;"
                >GNOME</ulink>, a leading UNIX and Linux desktop suite and development platform.</para>
            <para>Another leading UNIX and Linux desktop is <ulink url="&kde;">KDE</ulink>.
                Ubuntu does not currently make use of the KDE desktop by default.
                The reason for this is that the Ubuntu project does not, at this stage,
                have the resources to put the same level of pre-release work into the KDE packages
                as it devotes to those comprising GNOME.
                However, you will find all the KDE packages you could possibly want in Ubuntu's
                optional software library, "Universe". We do plan to eventually provide Ubuntu users
                with a choice between these two excellent desktop environments.
                To this end, we are working with the KDE team to make this choice a reality.</para>
            <para>In the meantime, the <ulink url="www.kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</ulink> project provides
                a testing-quality offering, which KDE fans are welcome to help develop.</para>

                Productivity software suite. It includes a word processor, a spreadsheet, and
                presentation software, all of which is largely compatible with popular proprietary

            <title>The Cost</title>
            <para>The Ubuntu project is entirely committed to the principles of open source software
                development; people are encouraged to use open source software, improve it, and pass
                it on. This means that Ubuntu is and will always be free of charge. That's right --
                this is not a typo -- Ubuntu does not and will never cost anything. There is no
                purchase price or license cost associated with Ubuntu.</para>
            <para>However, this means more than just being available at zero cost -- it's
                &apos;free&apos; as in &apos;free speech.&apos; In addition to the fact that you don't
                need to pay a cent for the software (media and download costs excluded), you may
                use, modify, and redistribute any and all parts of all open source software freely.
                Look at and borrow from the source code if you happen to be curious,
                or contribute to a project you like. Of course, there's nothing wrong with just using
                the software for your own purposes -- not everyone has to be a programmer.</para>

            <title>Backing and Support</title>
            <para>Ubuntu is maintained by a quickly growing community. The project initiative is
                sponsored by <ulink url="&canonical-url;">Canonical Ltd.</ulink>, a holding
                company founded by Mark Shuttleworth. Canonical mainly works to provide support and
                consulting services centred around Ubuntu.</para>
            <para>As an open source project, the primary source of support for the distribution is
                found in the forms of its documentation and community. These forms of support are
                free for everyone. However, a number of people are not computer fanatics and may find
                themselves in need of additional support. Furthermore, in many commercial environments,
                these free forms of support may prove inadequate and a dedicated source of support may
                be required.</para>
            <para>In such cases, private individuals and commercial organizations have the option of
                contracting commercial support, too. More information about <ulink

                improvements &quot;upstream&quot; and since we share a couple important
                upstreams (Debian and GNOME to start with) there may well be scope for collaboration
                between the projects. At this stage we haven't had any extensive discussions on how

            <para>The Ubuntu version numbering scheme is based on the date we release a version of
                the distribution. Our first release was in October, 2004, so its version was 4.10. Our
                next release, the one for which this document was written, will be in April, 2005, will be
                numbered 5.04. So the version number comes from the year and month of the release rather
                than reflecting the actual version of the software.</para>
            <para>Each Ubuntu release has a unique combination of component versions: kernel, X,
                Gnome, GCC, libc, etc. so an aggregate version number does not make much sense. We
