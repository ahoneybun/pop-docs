    <title>Device Manager</title>
    <para>The Device Manager shows information about the hardware that is currently installed in
        your system and which can be used by Ubuntu. Linux uses the so called
        <emphasis>HAL</emphasis> (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to access the hardware. Every
        application can use the HAL and does not need to know itself exactly how to use that piece
        of hardware. The goal of the HAL is to make hardware &quot;just work&quot; in a
        desktop system.</para>
    <para>There are very few options in the Device Manager. It is mostly useful for seeing what kind
        of graphic adaptor or sound card you have installed, without having to open and inspect your
        computer. The Device Manager is not a place to configure your hardware. Ubuntu probes your
        system and makes a best effort to determine which hardware you have and how to control it.</para>
