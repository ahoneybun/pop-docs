        <title>What is Gaim</title>
        <para>Gaim is the default instant messenger client in Ubuntu. With Gaim you can talk to
            people who use: AIM/ICQ, Gadu-Gadu, GroupWise, IRC, Jabber, MSN, Napster and Yahoo. The
            ability to use one client instead of multiple is a great benefit and allows you to have
            all of your buddies in one window so you can just click a name and talk. We will go over
            the different sections of Gaim and how to set it up to your liking.</para>
