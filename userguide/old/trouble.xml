			<title>Where did my panels go?</title>
			<para>
				My desktop started up one day with no panels at all (i.e. no
				&quot;applications, computer&quot; menu at the top, and no task list at
				the bottom). I don't know why.
			</para>
			<para>
				The fix was to start a terminal (right click on desktop, &quot;open
				terminal&quot;) and run the command &quot;gnome-panel&quot;. They started up
				again fine ... I checked &quot;Computer|Desktop
				Preferences|Sessions|Current Session&quot; and scrolled down to
				confirm that &quot;gnome-panel&quot; has the Style &quot;restart&quot; ... so I
				stopped the command-line panels (by hitting ctrl-C in the
				terminal) and the panels vanished, and restarted happlicationily.

				Some upgrades can be more intrusive than others, and in my most
				recent upgrade, Gnome experienced these problems. I tried to
				create a new user directory to no avail. Restarting the
				computer totally fixed the problem. OwenMarshall.

			<title>I have a black &quot;X&quot; in the middle of my screen, in addition to the normal mouse cursor.</title>
			<para>
				This is caused by problems with hardware acceleration of the
				cursor. You can work around this problem by editing
				/etc/X11/XF86Config-4 and adding the following line:
			</para>
			<screen>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;false&quot;</screen>
			<para>
				or
			</para>
			<screen>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;true&quot;</screen>
			<para>
				to the Device section of the file.
			</para>
			<para>
				Note that the option is specific for each video card driver.
			</para>
			<para>
				To be sure to enter the proper information check the man page
				for your driver.
			</para>
			<para>
				Examples:
			</para>
			<screen>man radeon</screen>
			<para>
				for ati cards or
			</para>
			<screen>man nv</screen>
			<para>
				for nvidia cards.
			</para>
