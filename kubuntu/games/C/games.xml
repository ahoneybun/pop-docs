<para>
One of the most common questions in the Linux community comes
from a majority of <trademark>Windows</trademark> users who all want to know the
same thing. Can Linux play <trademark>Windows</trademark> game titles? Yes and
No. There are some titles which can run natively in Linux just fine. This means
you will not have to utilize a third-party application or emulator in order to
play the game. However, most of the top titles at this time cannot be run
natively but can be run with the support of an emulator. An emulator allows an
application to run on a platform or operating system in which it wasn't intended
for. There are two popular emulators in use today in the Linux community:
