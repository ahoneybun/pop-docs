<title>Introduction to Kubuntu</title>

<para>
Welcome to Kubuntu &distro-rev;: the &distro-version; Release. Kubuntu is a
user-friendly Linux operating system that utilizes KDE, the K Desktop
Environment. With a predictable 6 month release cycle as part of the Ubuntu
project, Kubuntu is the Linux distribution for everyone. The entire Kubuntu team
would like to thank you for using Kubuntu.
</para>

<para>
Kubuntu includes more than 1,000 pieces of software and has access to more than
25,000 other applications to suit your needs. Kubuntu starts with Linux
version &linux-kernel-version; and KDE &kde-version;, and then covers every
standard desktop application from word processing and spreadsheet to Internet
access applications, web server software, email software, programming
languages and tools, and more.

<title>What is Linux?</title>

<para>
Linux is an operating system kernel that resembles the Unix operating system.
The kernel is the main software required for free operating systems such as
Kubuntu. Linux has come to define the worldwide movement to embrace free and
open source software. GNU/Linux is another way in which many refer to the Linux
kernel. The GNU/Linux term was created by the <ulink
url="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</ulink> since the Linux kernel
was created with the many components from the <ulink

<title>What is KDE?</title>

<para>
The default desktop environment for Kubuntu is KDE, a powerful Free Software
graphical desktop environment for Linux and Unix workstations. It combines ease
of use, contemporary functionality, and outstanding graphical design with the
technological superiority of the Unix operating system. KDE is one of many
desktop environments for Linux users. KDE sports an impressive array of easy to
use, but powerful, graphical interface applications for users of all ages in
both home and work environments. For developers, KDE provides a robust
application development framework that enables rapid creation of first rate
applications implementing cutting-edge technology.
</para>

For further information on KDE, refer to KDE's website located at <ulink
url="http://www.kde.org" />.

<sect2 id="KDE" status="complete">
<title>KDE for Ubuntu and Gnome Users</title>

<para>
KDE is in many ways similar to GNOME, but there are a few distinct differences
which distinguish KDE as a desktop environment. KDE uses C++ at its base, with
Qt (the Q-toolkit), whereas GNOME, using GTK, is written in C. KDE is the older
and most widely used desktop environment, and is known to stress more the
importance of features, and more recently, usability. GNOME more notoriously
prides itself on simplicity and ease of use. Popular criticisms of GNOME are
that it's lacking in features and applications, while it's often commented that
KDE has too many features which may themselves be hard to locate.
</para>

<para>
Nevertheless, KDE and GNOME respectively target different audiences, and are
fundamentally different in some respects, and the question of which desktop
environment is superior is inherently a subjective opinion in many ways.
Because of this, to at least make a proper decision about which is more suited
to yourself, it is advised that you try them both out. Thus, it is very easy to
install GNOME from a Kubuntu setup, and equally easy to install KDE from
an Ubuntu setup.
</para>

<title>Switching Desktops</title>

<para>
As an Ubuntu user, you may be concerned that your favorite GNOME applications
will not run under Kubuntu. That is not the case. In recent times, much work has
been done to increase compatibility between GNOME and KDE. Today, virtually
all GNOME applications will run under KDE and vice versa.
</para>

<para>
While the KDE desktop is very different from that of GNOME, all your favorite
GNOME applications will be integrated with your KDE menu system.
</para>

<para>
Another concern for users wanting to try Kubuntu may be that KDE will become
their only desktop once it is installed. While we do indeed hope you will make
KDE your desktop of choice, this is not the case; both desktop session types can
be run after installing Kubuntu. Furthermore, during installation you will be
given the choice of using either the GNOME Display Manager (GDM) or the K
Display Manager (KDM) as your login manager.
</para>

<para>
Either display manager will suffice, and after installation you will be able to
run both GNOME and KDE session types.  Feel free to try KDM.  You can always
switch back to GDM later if you like.  The only noticeable difference will be
the artwork used before you log in.
</para>

<para>
To install Kubuntu, you just need to install the
<emphasis>kubuntu-desktop</emphasis> package.
