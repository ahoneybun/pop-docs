"KDE is in many ways similar to GNOME, but there are a few distinct "
"differences which distinguish KDE as a desktop environment. KDE uses C++ at "
"its base, with Qt (the Q-toolkit), whereas GNOME, using GTK, is written in "
"C. KDE is the older and most widely used desktop environment, and is known "
"to stress more the importance of features, and more recently, usability. "
"GNOME more notoriously prides itself on simplicity and ease of use. Popular "
"criticisms of GNOME are that it's lacking in features and applications, "
"while it's often commented that KDE has too many features which may "
"themselves be hard to locate."

"Nevertheless, KDE and GNOME respectively target different audiences, and are "
"fundamentally different in some respects, and the question of which desktop "
"environment is superior is inherently a subjective opinion in many ways. "
"Because of this, to at least make a proper decision about which is more "
"suited to yourself, it is advised that you try them both out. Thus, it is "
"very easy to install GNOME from a Kubuntu distribution, and equally easy to "
"install KDE from an Ubuntu setup."

"尽管如此，KDE 和 GNOME "
"还是各有各的支持者，并且某些方面有着根本的差异；至于哪个桌面环境更强，答案显然由各自的主观意志而定。也正因如此，为了能够作"
"出正确选择，确定哪个更适合自己，这两个桌面环境您都应该试试。毕竟，在 Kubuntu 发行版上安装 GNOME 轻而易举，而在 Ubuntu 系统上安装 "
