"Built on the solid and advanced base of Ubuntu, the Kubuntu team aims to "
"create a distribution that provides an up-to-date and coherent Linux system "
"for desktop and server computing. Kubuntu includes a number of selected "
"packages from Ubuntu and is based on Debian's powerful <quote>Adept</quote> "
"package management system. Adept allows easy installation and clean removal "
"of programs, as well as automatic download of extra packages to satisfy "
"dependencies. Unlike most distributions that ship a wide range of software "
"packages that may or may not be of quality, Kubuntu's core list of packages "
"is reduced only to the most important applications. (Although for maximum "
"choice, you may choose from over 10,000 packages ready to download, rather "
"than being limited to the selected core.)"

"The default desktop environment for Kubuntu is KDE, a powerful Free Software "
"graphical desktop environment for Linux and Unix workstations. It combines "
"ease of use, contemporary functionality, and outstanding graphical design "
"with the technological superiority of the Unix operating system. KDE is one "
"of the two leading graphical desktop environments for Linux users. KDE "
"sports an impressive array of easy to use, but powerful, graphical interface "
"applications for users of all ages in both home and work environments. For "
"developers, KDE provides a robust application development framework that "
"enables rapid creation of first rate applications implementing cutting-edge "
"technology."

"KDE is in many ways similar to GNOME, but there are a few distinct "
"differences which distinguish KDE as a desktop environment. KDE uses C++ at "
"its base, with Qt (the Q-toolkit), whereas GNOME, using GTK, is written in "
"C. KDE is the older and most widely used desktop environment, and is known "
"to stress more the importance of features, and more recently, usability. "
"GNOME more notoriously prides itself on simplicity and ease of use. Popular "
"criticisms of GNOME are that it's lacking in features and applications, "
"while it's often commented that KDE has too many features which may "
"themselves be hard to locate."

"Nevertheless, KDE and GNOME respectively target different audiences, and are "
"fundamentally different in some respects, and the question of which desktop "
"environment is superior is inherently a subjective opinion in many ways. "
"Because of this, to at least make a proper decision about which is more "
"suited to yourself, it is advised that you try them both out. Thus, it is "
"very easy to install GNOME from a Kubuntu distribution, and equally easy to "
"install KDE from an Ubuntu setup."

"As an Ubuntu user, you may be concerned that your favorite GNOME "

"Another concern for users wanting to try Kubuntu may be that KDE will become "
"their only desktop once it is installed. While we do indeed hope you will "
"make KDE your desktop of choice, this is not the case; both desktop session "
"types can be run after installing Kubuntu. Furthermore, during installation "
"you will be given the choice of using either the GNOME Display Manager (GDM) "
"or the K Display Manager (KDM) as your login manager."

"Either display manager will suffice, and after installation you will be able "
