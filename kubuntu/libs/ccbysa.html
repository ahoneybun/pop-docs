not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the
Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor
You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit
as required by clause 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon

specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each
Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative
Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices
that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
the Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or use
of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.
The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work,

itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.</p></li><li><p>
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You
must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to
the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,
publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice,
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies
to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative
Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
"French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
