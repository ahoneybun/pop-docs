            available free of charge, that software tools should be usable
            by people in their local language and despite any disabilities,
            and that people should have the freedom to customize and alter
            their software in whatever way they see fit. For those reasons:

            <para>Ubuntu is a South African ethical ideology focusing on

                (pronounced "oo-BOON-too") is seen as a

                However, this means more than just being available at
                zero cost. The philosophy of Free Software is that
                people should be free to use software in all the ways
                that are "socially useful". "Free
                software" not only means that you shouldn't have
                to pay for it, it also means that you should be able to
                use the software in any way you wish.  The code that
                makes up Free Software is available for anyone to
                download, change, fix, and use in any way. So apart
                from the fact that Free Software is often available
                without charge, this freedom also has technical
                advantages: when programs are developed, the hard work
                of others can be used and built upon. This cannot
                happen with non-free Software, and when programs are
                developed, they have to start from scratch. For this
                reason the development of Free Software is fast,
                efficient and exciting!

            <title>The Difference</title>
            <para>
                There are many different operating systems based on Linux:
                Debian, SUSE, Gentoo, RedHat, and Mandriva for example. 
                Kubuntu is yet another contender in what
                is already a highly competitive world. So what makes
                Kubuntu different?</para>
            <para>
                Based on Debian, one of the most widely acclaimed,
                technologically advanced, and well-supported
                distributions, Kubuntu
                aims to create a distribution that provides
                an up-to-date and coherent Linux system for desktop and
                server computing. Kubuntu includes a number of carefully
                selected packages from the Debian distribution and
                retains its powerful package management system, which
                allows easy installation and clean removal of programs. Unlike most
                distributions that ship with a large amount of software
                that may or may not be of use, Kubuntu's list of packages
                is reduced to a number of important applications of high
                quality.
            </para>
            <para>
                By focusing on quality, Kubuntu produces a robust and
                feature-rich computing environment that is suitable for
                use in both home and commercial environments. The
                project takes the time required to focus on finer
                details and is able to release a version featuring the
                latest and greatest of today's software once every 6
                months. Kubuntu is available in flavors for the i386
                (386/486/Pentium(II/III/IV) and Athlon/Duron/Sempron
                processors), x86_64 (Athlon64, Opteron, and new 64-bit
                Intel processors), and PowerPC (iBook/Powerbook, G4 and
                G5) architectures.</para>

            <title>The Desktop</title>
            <para>The default desktop environment for Kubuntu is <ulink url="&kde;">KDE</ulink>, a leading UNIX and
                Linux desktop suite and development platform.</para>
            <para>Another leading UNIX and Linux desktop is <ulink url="&gnome;">Gnome</ulink>. Kubuntu does not 
                make use of the Gnome desktop by default. However, the
                <ulink url="&ubuntu-main;">Ubuntu</ulink> project offers
                Kubuntu users a choice between these two excellent desktop
                environments. Thanks to the efforts of the Ubuntu team,
                Kubuntu users are able to install and use the Gnome
                desktop easily on their system. The Gnome desktop can 
                be found in and downloaded from the main Ubuntu archive.
                The easiest way to get a working install of Ubuntu is
                <command>sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop</command>.
                This will install the different packages required and set
                everything up correctly.</para>

            <para>
                The Kubuntu version numbering scheme is based on the date we
                release a version of the distribution. The version number comes from the year
                and month of the release rather than reflecting the actual revision of the
                software. So, our first release (Hoary Hedgehog) was in April 2005, so its
                version was 5.04. The second release (Breezy Badger) was in October 2005, so
                its version number was 5.10, and our third release (Dapper Drake) was released in June 2006
		so its version number was 6.06. This version (&distro-version;) was released in
                &distro-release-date;, so its version number is &distro-rev;.

            <para>Linux was brought to life in 1991 by a Finnish student named

                kernel, intended to take advantage of the then-new i386

            <para>Nowadays, thanks to a substantial amount of development
