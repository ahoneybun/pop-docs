            <para>This is the first time the Ubuntu Documentation Team is
                releasing the Quick Guide. Hopefully this resource will grow
                from strength-to-strength in future releases. The Quick Guide is
                a great way to take a quick tour of the Ubuntu Desktop. It
                provides brief introductions and screen captures of all the
                applications installed by default.</para>
            <para>Also in this release is the FAQ Guide which was ported from
                the Ubuntu Wiki to Docbook and is now a permanent feature of the
                Ubuntu documentation project.</para>
            <para>We wish to thank all the contributors who spent hours of their
                time developing not only the documents but also the
                documentation framework. This was a large part of the current
                documentation release. Hopefully the next release will need less
                work on the framework and we will see more and improved content
                in the documents.</para>
            <para>Special thanks must go to John Hornbeck for allowing the
                repository to originally be hosted on his machine and keeping it
                up for so long. Good news is that, with the help of the
                Canonical team, the repository has now moved and is running in
                the Canonical server farm. Thanks Canonical for finally doing
                the move.</para>

            <para>This book is a quick guide to the world of the Ubuntu Desktop.
                It's a great way to get familiar with what you will find in a
                pristine Ubuntu Desktop directly after installation. The quick
                guide is like a visual tour of the desktop providing pictures,
                useful information and tips at every step of the tour.</para>
            <para>As a quick guide, this book does not aim to be a comprehensive
                reference to everything you will learn about the Ubuntu Desktop.

                familiar with using mouse and keyboard.</para>

            <para id="about1">Ubuntu is a complete open source operating
                system built around the Linux kernel. The Ubuntu community is
                made up of software developers, translators, folks who love to
                write documentation, and most importantly the people who use
                Ubuntu every day. We invite you to join this community and help
                to make Ubuntu the operating system your family and friends and
                office colleagues will love to use. Help to translate Ubuntu
                into your own language, test it on new laptops, servers and
                other exciting hardware, improve the web site with hints, tips
                and FAQ's, or help to define the set of software that is
                installed by default for future Ubuntu releases.</para>
            <para id="about2">The Ubuntu community is built on the ideas
                enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto: that software should be
                available free of charge, that software tools should be usable
                by people in their local language and despite any disabilities,
                and that people should have the freedom to customize and alter
                their software in whatever way they see fit. For those reasons: <itemizedlist>

                <para>Ubuntu is a South African ethic ideology focusing on
                    people's allegiances and relations with each other. The word
                    comes from the Zulu and Xhosa languages. Ubuntu, pronounced
                    &quot;oo-BOON-too,&quot; is seen as a traditional
                    African concept and is seen as one of the founding
                    principles of the new republic of South Africa and connected
                    to the idea of an African Renaissance.</para>
                <para>A rough translation of Ubuntu's principles could be
                    &quot;humanity towards others.&quot; Another

                    others are able and good, for he or she has a proper
                    self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or she
                    belongs in a greater whole and is diminished when others are

                <title>The Difference</title>
                <para>There are many GNU/Linux distributions (e.g., Redhat,
                    SuSE, Debian, Mandrake) but Ubuntu distinguishes itself as a
                    different, better, kind of distribution.</para>
                <para>Built on the solid and advanced base of Debian, Ubuntu
                    aims to create a distribution that provides an
                    up-to-date and coherent GNU/Linux system for desktop and server
                    computing. Ubuntu includes a number of selected packages
                    from the Debian distribution and is still based on its
                    powerful package management system that allows easy
                    installation and clean removal of program packages as well
                    as automatically downloading extra packages to satisfy
                    dependencies. Unlike most distributions that ship a wide
                    range of software packages that may or may not be of
                    quality, Ubuntu's list of packages is reduced to a number of
                    important applications of high quality.</para>
                <para>By focusing on quality, Ubuntu produces a robust and
                    feature rich computing environment that is flexible for use
                    in home and commercial environments. The project has more
                    time to spend on the finer details and is able to release a
                    version featuring the latest and greatest of today's
                    software, every 6 months. Ubuntu ships with versions for
                    i386 (Pentium CPUs / IBM-compatible PCs), AMD-64 (Hammer)
                    and PowerPC (iBook/Powerbook, G4 and G5)

                    install the KDE desktop by default. The reason for this is
                    that the project does not, at this stage, have the resources
                    to put the same level of post-freeze work into the KDE
                    packages as is put into the GNOME packages. However, you
                    will find all the KDE packages you could want in the
                    universe component of Ubuntu. We do eventually intend to give
                    Ubuntu users a choice between these most excellent desktops.

                before making changes to it. Doing so will ensure that all

                <para>The <application>Network Proxy</application> preference
                    tool enables you to configure how your system connects to
                    the Internet. You can optionally configure your system to
                    connect to a proxy server, and specify the details of the
                    proxy server. A proxy server is a network service that
                    intercepts requests from client computers and attempts to
                    fulfill them on their behalf. In doing so, the contents of
                    pages requested are cached. When the proxy receives another
                    request for the same content, it checks if the content on
                    the remote server has been updated. If not, then it sends
                    the cached page to the requesting client computer. If yes,
                    then it renews the cached copy and sends the new content to
                    the client. In this way proxy servers reduce the time it
                    takes to fetch pages across the network.</para>
                <para>Specify the proxy server for each of the network protocols
                    by entering a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or
                    IP-address of the proxy server into the fields provided. In
                    most cases the same server can be used for all network
                    protocols. A FQDN name is a unique alphabetic identifier for
                    a computer on a network. An example FQDN for a proxy server
                    would be &quot;proxy.myisp.com.&quot; An IP-address
                    is a unique numeric identifier for a computer on a network.
                    An example IP-address would be
                    &quot;192.168.0.1.&quot;</para>

                    <para>Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) provide proxy

                    using Virtual Network Connection (VNC) technology. A
                        <application>VNC Viewer</application> application
                    permits users on remote computers to connect to, access and
                    interact with a user desktop as though they were physically
                    sitting infront of the computer to which they are connected.
                    One of the main purposes of this feature is to allow a
                    remotely located system administrator or help desk operator
                    to make changes to your system for you. You would normally
                    not have this option enabled.</para>

            <para>The <guimenuitem>Lock screen</guimenuitem> option is used to
                secure the computer without ending the current session. It is
                useful when you want to secure your computer while away for a
                few minutes, like when you need to get coffee. When you return,
                just enter your username and password to unlock the screen and
                continue the session.</para>
