				it is best for each person to have their own user account.
				This way they can have separate settings, documents, and other files.
				If necessary, files can also be protected

			</para>

			<title>Set up a firewall</title>
			<para>You may wish to install a firewall to protect your computer against unauthorized access by people on the Internet or your network. Firewalls block connections to your computer from unknown sources, which helps to prevent security breaches. If you use a router to connect to the Internet, the router may already have a firewall configured which regulates connections from the Internet to your network. This section deals with setting up a firewall on Ubuntu to regulate connections to your computer.</para>
			<sect2>
				<title>Firewall configuration tools</title>
				<para><application>Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)</application> is the standard firewall configuration program in Ubuntu. It is a command line program. Most users will prefer to use <application>Gufw</application>, which is a graphical program to configure <application>UFW</application>.</para>
				<para>Advanced users may wish to use <application>UFW</application> directly in the terminal. See the <ulink type="help" url="man:ufw">UFW manual</ulink> or the <ulink url='https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW'>Community Documentation page on <application>UFW</application></ulink> for more information.  Alternatively, you can use <application>iptables</application> - see the <ulink type="help" url="man:iptables">iptables manual</ulink>.</para>

				<para>From time to time, you may be sent an email which carries a virus or links to a fraudulent website. This type of email is very common, and it is important to learn how to deal with it, in order to prevent your computer or your personal details from being compromised or misused.</para>
				<para>Such messages are often received from total strangers. However, sometimes an email may appear to be from someone you know, when really it is not. This is because it is possible to include a fake sender email address in emails.</para>
				<para>Unwanted (unsolicited) mail tends to fall in to one of several categories:</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>Spam (junk) email, where people offer unwanted services and products</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Scam emails, where people pretend to ask for help in exchange for large sums of money</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Phishing email, where the message appears to be from a bank or other online service, asking you to enter your personal and financial details, or passwords.</para></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				
				<para>Below are some tips for keeping safe online:</para>
				
				<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>You should never reply to unsolicited mail, or even click on the links in the mail. Doing so usually results in more junk mail being sent to you.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Never click on links in emails which lead to websites asking for your password or similar. It is possible for the text of the link to give one address, when really it opens up another (possibly dangerous) address. Instead, type the link into your web browser yourself and proceed from there.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>If a website asks for your financial details, ensure that it is secure. In the <application>Firefox Web browser</application>, secure websites have a <emphasis>blue</emphasis> background surrounding the icon to the left of the address bar. Additionally, the site name and a padlock icon are displayed in the lower-right corner of the browser window. Click on the padlock to read more information about the security of the website.</para></listitem>

The causes of such <emphasis>data loss</emphasis> are many and varied; it could be anything from a power cut to accidentally deleting a file. It is highly recommended that you make regular back-up copies of your important files so that, if you do encounter a problem, you will not have lost those files.</para>
				
				<para>It is wise to store back-up copies of files separately from your computer; that is, you should make use of some form of file storage which is not permanently attached to your computer. Options include:</para>

				<para>A simple way of backing-up your files is to manually copy them to a safe location (see above) by using the <application>File Browser</application>.</para>
				<para>Alternatively, you can use a dedicated back-up application, such as <application>Simple Backup Suite</application>.</para>
				<procedure>

			<note><para>The Simple Backup Suite does not provide an option to write backup files directly to CDs or DVDs. You have to write backup manualy using for example a Brasero Disc Burning software (&brasero;). Alternatively you can customize <application>Simple Backup Config</application> to backup your files into another place (eg. remote server or external drives). See <ulink url='https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem/SimpleBackupSuite'>community help wiki</ulink> for details how to use Simple Backup Suite software.

If you want to restore in a different location you need to select the <guibutton>Restore As</guibutton> option.</para>
