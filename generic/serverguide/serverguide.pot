Traffic from your private network destined for the Internet must be manipulated for replies to be routable back to the machine that made the request. To do this, the kernel must modify the <emphasis>source</emphasis> IP address of each packet so that replies will be routed back to it, rather than to the private IP address that made the request, which is impossible over the Internet. Linux uses <emphasis>Connection Tracking</emphasis> (conntrack) to keep track of which connections belong to which machines and reroute each return packet accordingly. Traffic leaving your private network is thus \"masqueraded\" as having originated from your Ubuntu gateway machine. This process is referred to in Microsoft documentation as Internet Connection Sharing."

msgid "Before you start, make sure to back up every file that is now on your system. If this is the first time a non-native operating system has been installed on your computer, it's quite likely you will need to re-partition your disk to make room for Ubuntu. Any time you partition your disk, you should be prepared to lose everything on the disk should you make a mistake or something goes wrong during partitioning such as power loss to the system. The programs used in installation are quite reliable, and most have seen years of use, but they also perform destructive actions, and one mistake in use can result in loss of your valuable data."
