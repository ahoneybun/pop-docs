However, static routing does present some disadvantages as well. For example, static routing is limited to small networks, and does not scale well. Static routing also fails completely to adapt to network outages, and failures along the route due to the fixed nature of the route."

Dynamic routing has several advantages over static routing, such as superior scalability, and the ability to adapt to failures, and outages along network routes. Additionally, there is less manual configuration of the routing tables, since routers learn from one another about their existence and available routes. This trait also eliminates the possibility of introducing mistakes in the routing tables via human error. Dynamic routing is not perfect however, and presents disadvantages such as heightened complexity, and additional network overhead from router communications, which does not immediately benefit the end-users, but still consumes network bandwidth."

msgid "Before you start, make sure to back up every file that is now on your system. If this is the first time a non-native operating system has been installed on your computer, it's quite likely you will need to re-partition your disk to make room for Ubuntu Server 6.04. Anytime you partition your disk, you should be prepared to lose everything on the disk should you make a mistake, or something goes wrong during partitioning such as unrecoverable power loss to the system. The programs used in installation are quite reliable, and most have seen years of use, but they also perform destructive actions, and one mistake in use can result in loss of your valuable data."
