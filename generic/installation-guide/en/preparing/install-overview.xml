 <title>Overview of the Installation Process</title>
<para>

First, just a note about re-installations. With Ubuntu, a
circumstance that will require a complete re-installation of your
system is very rare; perhaps mechanical failure of the hard disk would
be the most common case.

</para><para>

Many common operating systems may require a complete installation to
be performed when critical failures take place or for upgrades to new
OS versions. Even if a completely new installation isn't required,
often the programs you use must be re-installed to operate properly in
the new OS.

</para><para>

Under Ubuntu, it is much more likely that your OS can be repaired
rather than replaced if things go wrong. Upgrades never require a
wholesale installation; you can always upgrade in-place. And the
programs are almost always compatible with successive OS releases.  If
a new program version requires newer supporting software, the Ubuntu
packaging system ensures that all the necessary software is
automatically identified and installed. The point is, much effort has
been put into avoiding the need for re-installation, so think of it as
your very last option. The installer is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
designed to re-install over an existing system.

Here's a road map for the steps you will take during the installation
process.

If you have problems during the installation, it helps to know which
packages are involved in which steps. Introducing the leading software
actors in this installation drama:

</para><para>

The installer software, <classname>debian-installer</classname>, is
the primary concern of this manual. It detects hardware and loads
appropriate drivers, uses <classname>dhcp-client</classname> to set up the
network connection, and runs <classname>debootstrap</classname> to install
the base system packages. Many more actors play smaller parts in this process,
but <classname>debian-installer</classname> has completed its task when
you load the new system for the first time.

</para><para>

To tune the system to your needs, <classname>tasksel</classname> allows you
to choose to install various predefined bundles of software like a Web
server or a Desktop environment.

</para><para arch="not-s390">

Just be aware that the X system is completely separate from
<classname>debian-installer</classname>, and in fact is much more
complicated. Installation and trouble shooting of the X window
installation is not within the scope of this manual.
