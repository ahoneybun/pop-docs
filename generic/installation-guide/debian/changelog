    installer images.

  * debian/control: Comment out stanzas for non-Ubuntu architectures rather
    than changing the Architecture to disabled, to avoid the .dsc ending up

installation-guide (20060102ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Merge changes from debian-installer in breezy:
    - Build only English (for now, until we figure out how to avoid trashing
      translations quite so badly with Ubuntu branding etc.).
    - Build only Ubuntu architectures (amd64, hppa, i386, ia64, powerpc,
      sparc).
    - Extensive (although possibly incomplete) Ubuntu branding, adjustments
      for our mirror layout, etc.
    - Describe X.Org rather than XFree86.
    - Add "Ubuntu and Debian" and "What is Ubuntu?" section, text borrowed
      from the Ubuntu web site. Disable the "What is Debian GNU/Linux?"
      section.
    - Direct installation reports to ubuntu-users for now.
    - Adjust various disk space requirements. Talk about the default Ubuntu
      desktop rather than Debian tasks.
    - Document mounting /sys in various places.
    - Unset supports-floppy-boot for all our architectures.
    - Add a few more supports-floppy-boot and bootable-usb conditionals.
    - Change references to /var/log/debian-installer to just
      /var/log/installer.
    - Disable discussion of MTA and PPP configuration.
    - Document our root password and sudo arrangements.
    - Talk about powerpc64 rather than power3 and power4.
    - Document netboot-style USB images. Still mention the hd-media images,
      but they're downplayed since many USB sticks are too small for a full
      Ubuntu ISO image.
    - Document Kickstart installations (currently only the basics, a
      reference to Red Hat's documentation, and the differences from
      Anaconda).
    - Mention /srv in the description of the filesystem hierarchy.
    - Document archive-copier.
  * Bump kernelversion to 2.6.15.
  * Bump release version and names for Dapper.
  * Bump x11ver to 7.0.
  * Update URL to README.mouse.
  * Update preseeding information.
  * Hardcode dapper in example preseed file, since the script that extracts
    example-preseed.txt doesn't expand entities like &releasename; (closes:
    Ubuntu #17578).
  * Update GNOME version to 2.12.
  * Update archive-copier documentation to reflect the new single-stage
    installer arrangements.
  * Re-enable documentation of iso-scan.
  * Adjust packaging to build the manual only for English and for Ubuntu
    architectures. Add installation-guide-amd64.
  * Hardcode SUITE to etch (yes, really; this makes sure features introduced
    upstream after sarge are documented).
