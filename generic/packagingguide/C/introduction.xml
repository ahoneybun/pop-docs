		<para>Welcome to the &ubuntu; Packaging Guide! This guide is primarily addressed to
			those who would like to make and maintain &ubuntu; packages. Although many of
			the concepts in this guide could be used to make binary packages for personal
			use, it is designed for those people wanting to distribute their packages to
			and for others.  While it is also written with the &ubuntu; linux distribution
			in mind, it should also be useful for any .deb based distibution.</para>

		<para>There are several reasons why you might want to learn how to package for
			Ubuntu. First, building and fixing &ubuntu; packages is a great way to
			contribute to the &ubuntu; community. It is also a good way to learn how
			&ubuntu; and the applications you have installed work, or maybe, you want to
			install a package that is not in the &ubuntu; repositories. Hopefully after you
			have completed this guide you will have the tools and knowledge you need to do
			all of these.</para>
	
		<para>This guide assumes that the reader has a reasonable knowledge of general
			linux tools and installation of linux software in &ubuntu;.  Basically, you should
			be able to use the terminal with ease and be familiar with apt tools (for
			example, apt-get, aptitude or synaptic).</para>
		
		<para>Besides this guide, there are many resources available to people trying to
			learn how to package for &ubuntu;/Debian:
