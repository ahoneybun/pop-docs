	<title>Basic Packaging</title>

	<para>Two of the problems that many novice packagers face are that there
		are multiple ways of packaging, and there is more than one tool
		to do the job. We will go through three examples with the common
		build systems. First, we will use no build helper. This approach is
		usually the most difficult and is not often used in
		practice but gives the most straightforward look at the packaging
		process. Second, we will use
		<application>debhelper</application>, the most common build system in
		Debian. It helps the packager by automating repetitive
		tasks. Third, we will briefly cover the
		<emphasis role="bold">C</emphasis>ommon <emphasis
			role="bold">D</emphasis>ebian <emphasis
			role="bold">B</emphasis>uild <emphasis
			role="bold">S</emphasis>ystem (<application>CDBS</application>), a more streamlined build
		system that uses <application>debhelper</application>.</para>

	<tip><para>Package development often requires installing many packages
			(especially <application>-dev</application> packages containing
			headers and other common development files) that are not
			part of a normal desktop &ubuntu; installation. If you want
			to avoid installing extra packages or would like to develop for a
			different &ubuntu; release (the development one, for instance) from
			what you currently have, the use of a chroot environment
			is highly recommended. A guide to setting up a <xref
				linkend="appendix-chroot"/> can be found in the
			Appendix.</para></tip>

		<title>Packaging From Scratch</title>
		
		<important><para><emphasis role="bold">Requirements:</emphasis> build-essential,
				automake, gnupg, lintian, fakeroot and <xref linkend="gs-pbuilder"/>.</para>
		</important>
					
		<para>In this example we will be using the GNU <application><ulink
					url="http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/hello.html">hello</ulink></application>
			program as our example. You can download the source tarball from
			<ulink
				url="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz">ftp.gnu.org</ulink>.
			For the purposes of this example, we will be using the
			<filename>~/hello/</filename> directory.</para>
		<screen>
mkdir ~/hello
cd ~/hello
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz</screen>

		<para>We will also compare our package to one that is already
			packaged in the &ubuntu; repository. For now, we will place
			it in the <filename>ubuntu</filename> directory so we can look at
			it later. To get the source
			package, make sure you have a "deb-src" line in your
			<filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename> file for the Main
			repository. Then, simply execute:</para>

		<screen>
mkdir ubuntu
cd ubuntu
apt-get source hello
cd ..</screen>
		
		<note><para>Unlike most <application>apt-get</application> commands, you do not
				need to have root privileges to get the source package, because it is
				downloaded to the current directory. In fact, it is recommended that you
				<emphasis>only</emphasis> use <application>apt-get source</application>
				as a regular user, because then you can edit files in the source package
				without needing root privileges.</para></note>
		
		<para>What the <application>apt-get source</application> command does is:</para>
		
		<orderedlist>

			<listitem><para>Download the source package. A source package commonly contains
					a .dsc file describing the package and giving md5sums for the
					source package, an .orig.tar.gz file containing the source code from the
					author(s), and a .diff.gz file containing patches applied against the
					source code with the packaging information.</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>Untar the .orig.tar.gz file into the current directory.
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>Apply the gunzipped .diff.gz to the unpacked source
					directory.</para></listitem>

			</orderedlist>

		<para>If you manually download the source package (.dsc, .orig.tar.gz, and
			.diff.gz files), you can unpack them in the same way <application>apt-get
				source</application> does by using <application>dpkg-source</application>
			as follows:</para>
		<para><screen>dpkg-source -x *.dsc</screen></para>

		<para>The first thing you will need to do is make a copy of the
			original (sometimes called "upstream") tarball in the following
			format:
			<filename>&lt;packagename&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz</filename>.
			This step does two things. First, it creates two copies of the source
			code.  If you accidentally change or delete the working copy you can
			use the one you downloaded. Second, it is considered poor
			packaging practice to change the original source tarball unless
			absolutely necessary. See <xref linkend="basic-mistakes"/> for
			reasons.</para>

		<screen>
cp hello-2.1.1.tar.gz hello_2.1.1.orig.tar.gz
tar -xzvf hello_2.1.1.orig.tar.gz</screen>

		<warning><para>The underscore, "_", between the package name (hello) and the
				version (2.1.1), as opposed to a hyphen, "-", is very important. Your
				source package will incorrectly be built as a Debian native
				package.</para></warning>

		<para>We now have a <filename>hello-2.1.1</filename> directory
			containing the source files. Now we need to create the customary
			<application>debian</application> directory where all the
			packaging information is stored, allowing us to separate the
			packaging files from the application source files.</para>

		<screen>
mkdir hello-2.1.1/debian
cd hello-2.1.1/debian/</screen>

		<para>We now need to create the essential files for any &ubuntu;
			source package: <filename>changelog</filename>,
			<filename>control</filename>, <filename>copyright</filename>, and
			<filename>rules</filename>. These are the files needed to create
			the binary packages (.deb files) from the original (upstream)
			source code. Let us look at each one in turn.</para>
		
		<sect2>
			<title>changelog</title>
			
			<para>The <filename>changelog</filename> file is, as its name
				implies, a listing of the changes made in each version. It
				has a specific format that gives the package name, version,
				distribution, changes, and who made the changes
				at a given time. If you have a GPG key, make sure to use the same name
				and email address in <filename>changelog</filename> as you
				have in your key. The following is a template
				<filename>changelog</filename>:</para>
			<screen>
package (version) distribution; urgency=urgency

  * change details
    more change details
  * even more change details

-- maintainer name &lt;email address&gt;[two spaces]  date</screen>

			<para>The format (especially of the date) is important. The date
				should be in RFC822 format, which can be obtained from the
				<application>822-date</application> program.</para>

			<para>Here is a sample <filename>changelog</filename> file for
				<application>hello</application>:</para>

			<screen>
hello (2.1.1-1) dapper; urgency=low

   * New upstream release with lots of bug fixes.

-- Captain Packager &lt;packager@coolness.com&gt;  Wed,  5 Apr 2006 22:38:49 -0700</screen>

			<para>Notice that the version has a -1 appended to it, or
				what is called the Debian revision, which is used so that the
				packaging can be updated (to fix bugs for example) with new
				uploads within the same source release version.</para>

			<note><para>&ubuntu; and Debian have slightly different package versioning
					schemes to avoid conflicting packages with the same
					source version. If a Debian package has been changed in &ubuntu;,
					it has <emphasis>ubuntuX</emphasis> (where
					<emphasis>X</emphasis> is the &ubuntu; revision number)
					appended to the end of the Debian version. So if the
					Debian <application>hello</application> package was
					changed by &ubuntu;, the version string would be
					<filename>2.1.1-1ubuntu1</filename>. If a package for the
					application does not exist in Debian, then the Debian
					revision is <emphasis>0</emphasis>
					(<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis>,
					<filename>2.1.1-0ubuntu1</filename>).</para></note>
		
			<para>Now look at the <filename>changelog</filename> for the
				&ubuntu; source package that we downloaded earlier:</para>

			<screen>
less ../../ubuntu/hello-2.1.1/debian/changelog</screen>

			<para>Notice that in this case the <emphasis>distribution</emphasis>
				is <emphasis>unstable</emphasis> (a Debian branch),
				because the Debian package has not been changed by &ubuntu;.
				Remember to set the <emphasis>distribution</emphasis> to your
				target distribution release.</para>

			<para>At this point create a <filename>changelog</filename> file
				in the <filename>debian</filename> directory where you should
				still be.</para>
			
		</sect2>

		<sect2>
			<title>control</title>
			<para>The control file contains the information that the package
				manager (such as <application>apt-get</application>,
				<application>synaptic</application>, and
				<application>aptitude</application>) uses, build-time dependencies,
				maintainer information, and much more.</para>
			<para>For the &ubuntu; <application>hello</application> package,
				the control file looks something like:</para>
			<para><screen>Source: hello
Section: devel
Priority: optional
Maintainer: Captain Packager &lt;packager@coolness.com&gt; 
Standards-Version: 3.6.1

Package: hello
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: The classic greeting, and a good example
 The GNU hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
 allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which
 would otherwise be unavailable to them.
 .
 Seriously, though: this is an example of how to do a Debian
 package.
 It is the Debian version of the GNU Project's `hello world' program
 (which is itself an example for the GNU Project).</screen></para>

			<para>Create <filename>control</filename> using the
				information above (making sure to provide your information for
				the <emphasis>Maintainer</emphasis> field).</para>
			
			<para>The first paragraph gives information about the source package. Let us
				go through each line: </para>
			<itemizedlist>
				
				<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Source:</emphasis> This is the name

						<emphasis>hello</emphasis>.</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Section:</emphasis> The apt

						categorization of software. In this case,
						<application>hello</application> belongs in the
						<emphasis>devel</emphasis> section.</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Priority:</emphasis> This sets the
						importance of the package to users. It should be one of the
						following:</para>

					<itemizedlist>
					
						<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Required</emphasis> -

						<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Important</emphasis> -
								minimal set of packages for a usable system. Removing these

								System.</para></listitem>
						
						<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Standard</emphasis> -
								Somewhat self explanatory.</para></listitem>
						
						<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Optional</emphasis> - in

								not conflict with each other.</para></listitem>
						
						<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Extra</emphasis> - packages

					</itemizedlist>
				</listitem>

				<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Maintainer:</emphasis> The

				<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Build-Depends:</emphasis> One of the

						needed. The list of build-essential packages can be found at
						<filename>/usr/share/doc/build-essential/list</filename>.
				</para></listitem>
			
			</itemizedlist>

		
			<para>The second paragraph is for the binary package that will be built from

				Again, let us go through each line:</para>
			
			<itemizedlist>
			
				<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Package:</emphasis> The name for the

					</itemizedlist></listitem>

				<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Depends:</emphasis> The list of

		<sect2>
			<title>copyright</title>

			<para>This file gives the copyright information. Generally, copyright information
				is found in the <filename>COPYING</filename> file in the program's source
				directory. This file should include such information as the names of the
				author and the packager, the URL from which the source came, a
				Copyright line with the year and copyright holder, and the text of the
				copyright itself. An example template would be:</para>

			<screen>This package was debianized by {Your Name} &lt;your email address&gt;

It was downloaded from: {URL of webpage} 

Upstream Author(s): {Name(s) and email address(es) of author(s)}

Copyright:
	Copyright (C) {Year(s)} by {Author(s)} {Email address(es)}

License:

</screen>

			<para>As one can imagine, <application>hello</application> is

				just copy the <filename>copyright</filename> file from the
				&ubuntu; package:</para>

			<screen>
cp ../../ubuntu/hello-2.1.1/debian/copyright .</screen>

			<para>You must include the complete copyright unless it is is GPL, LGPL, BSD, or
				Artistic License, in which case you can refer to the corresponding file in the
				<filename>/usr/share/common-licenses/</filename> directory.</para>

			<para>Notice that the &ubuntu; package's
				<filename>copyright</filename> includes a license statement for
				the manual. It is important that <emphasis>all</emphasis> the

		</sect2>	

		<sect2 id="basic-scratch-rules">
			<title>rules</title>
			
			<para>The <filename>rules</filename> file is an executable

			<para>Let us go through this file in some detail. One of the first
				parts you will see is the declaration of some variables:</para>
			<screen>package = hello
docdir = debian/tmp/usr/share/doc/$(package)

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -g -Wall
INSTALL_PROGRAM = install

ifeq (,$(findstring noopt,$(DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS)))
  CFLAGS += -O2
endif
ifeq (,$(findstring nostrip,$(DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS)))
  INSTALL_PROGRAM += -s
endif
</screen>
			<para>This section sets the CFLAGS for the compiler and also handles the
				<filename>noopt</filename> and <filename>nostrip</filename> DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS for debugging.
			</para>
			
			<para>Next is the <filename>build</filename> rule:</para>
			<screen>build:
	$(checkdir)
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	$(MAKE) CC="$(CC)" CFLAGS="$(CFLAGS)"
	touch build</screen>
			<para>This rule runs <emphasis>./configure</emphasis> with the proper prefix,
runs <emphasis>make</emphasis>, and creates a <filename>build</filename> file that is a timestamp of the
build to prevent erroneous multiple compilations.</para>
			<para>The next rule is <filename>clean</filename>, which runs <emphasis>make -i distclean</emphasis>
and removes the files that are made during the package building.</para>

			<screen>clean:
	$(checkdir)
	rm -f build
	-$(MAKE) -i distclean
	rm -rf *~ debian/tmp debian/*~ debian/files* debian/substvars</screen>

			<para>Next we see an empty <filename>binary-indep</filename> rule, because there are no 
			architecture-independent files created in this package.</para>

			<para>There are, however, many architecture-dependent files, so <filename>binary-arch</filename> is
used:</para>

			<screen>binary-arch:    checkroot build
		$(checkdir)
		rm -rf debian/tmp
		install -d debian/tmp/DEBIAN $(docdir)
		install -m 755 debian/postinst debian/prerm debian/tmp/DEBIAN
		$(MAKE) INSTALL_PROGRAM="$(INSTALL_PROGRAM)" \
		prefix=$$(pwd)/debian/tmp/usr install
		cd debian/tmp &amp;&amp; mv usr/info usr/man usr/share
		cp -a NEWS debian/copyright $(docdir)
		cp -a debian/changelog $(docdir)/changelog.Debian

		dpkg --build debian/tmp ..</screen>
			
			<para>First, notice that this rule calls the
<filename>checkroot</filename> rule to make sure the package is built as root and calls the
<filename>build</filename> rule to compile the source. Then the <filename>debian/tmp/DEBIAN</filename> and
<filename>debian/tmp/usr/share/doc/hello</filename> files are created, and the <filename>postinst</filename> 
and the <filename>prerm></filename> scripts are installed to <filename>debian/tmp/DEBIAN</filename>. Then
<emphasis>make install</emphasis> is run with a prefix that installs to the
<filename>debian/tmp/usr</filename> directory. Afterward the documentation files (NEWS, ChangeLog, and the debian
changelog) are gzipped and installed. <emphasis>dpkg-shlibdeps</emphasis> is invoked to find the shared
library dependencies of the <application>hello</application> executable, and it stores the list in the
<filename>debian/substvars</filename> file for the ${shlibs:Depends} variable in
<filename>control</filename>. Then <emphasis>dpkg-gencontrol</emphasis> is run to create a control file for
the binary package, and it makes the substitutions created by <emphasis>dpkg-shlibdeps</emphasis>. Finally, after
the permissions of the <filename>debian/tmp</filename> have been set, <emphasis>dpkg --build</emphasis> is run
to build the binary .deb package and place it in the parent directory.</para>

		</sect2>

		<sect2> 
			<title>postinst and prerm</title> 
			
			<para>The <filename>postinst</filename> and
				<filename>prerm</filename> files are examples of maintainer
				scripts.  They are shell scripts that are executed after
				installation and before removal, respectively, of the package. In the case of
				the &ubuntu; <application>hello</application> package, they
				are used to install (and remove) the info file. Go ahead and
				copy them into the current <filename>debian</filename>
				directory.</para>

			<title>Building the Source Package</title>
			
			<para>Now that we have gone through the files in the
				<filename>debian</filename> directory for
				<application>hello</application> in detail, we can build the
				source (and binary) packages. First let us move into the
				root of the extracted source:</para>
			
			<para><screen>cd ..</screen></para>
			
			<para>Now we build the source package using
				<application>dpkg-buildpackage</application>:</para>
			
			<para><screen>dpkg-buildpackage -S -rfakeroot</screen></para>
			
			<para> The -S flag tells
				<application>dpkg-buildpackage</application> to build a source
				package, and the -r flag tells it to use
				<application>fakeroot</application> to allow us to have fake
				root privileges when making the package.
				<application>dpkg-buildpackage</application> will take the
				<filename>.orig.tar.gz</filename> file and produce a
				<filename>.diff.gz</filename> (the difference between
				the original tarball from the author and the directory we
				have created, <filename>debian/</filename> and its contents)

				description and md5sums for the source package. The
				<filename>.dsc</filename> and
				<filename>*_source.changes</filename> (used for uploading the
				source package) files are signed using your GPG key. If you do not
				have a GPG key, add the <emphasis>-us -uc</emphasis> flags to the invocation of
				<application>dpkg-buildpackage</application>. Your package

			<para>Using <application>pbuilder</application> to build the
				binary packages is very important. It ensures that the build
				dependencies are correct, because
				<application>pbuilder</application> provides only a minimal
				environment, so all the build-time dependencies are
				determined by the <filename>control</filename> file.</para>

			<title>Changing the Original Tarball</title>

			<para>There are two types of source packages, native and non-native.
				A native package is one that is specific to &ubuntu;/Debian. It has the
				<application>debian/</application> directory containing the packaging
				information and any changes to the source included in the tarball (usually
				&lt;packagename&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz). Non-native packages are more
				common. A non-native package splits
				the source package into a &lt;packagename&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz
				tarball that is identical (hopefully including md5sum) to the source
				tarball downloaded from the project's homepage and a .diff.gz file that
				contains all the differences (<filename>debian/</filename> directory and
				patches) from the original source tarball.</para>

			<para>Here is a list of potential problems that can occur if you change the
				original tarball:</para>
		
			<orderedlist>

				<listitem><para>Reproducibility</para>

					<para>If you take just the .diff.gz and .dsc, you or someone else has
						no means to reproduce the changes in the
						original tarball.</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para>Upgradeability</para>
		
					<para>It is much easier to upgrade to a new upstream (from the author)
						version if the .orig.tar.gz is preserved and there is a clear
						separation between the upstream source and the changes made to
						produce the &ubuntu; source package.</para> </listitem>

				<listitem><para>Debian to &ubuntu; Synchronization</para>

					<para>Changing original tarballs makes it hard to automatically sync
						from Debian to &ubuntu;. Normally, only the .diff.gz and .dsc files
						change within the same upstream version, since the .orig.tar.gz
						file is shared by all the Debian or &ubuntu; revisions. It is much
						more difficult to sync if the md5sums of the .orig.tar.gz files
						are not the same.</para> </listitem>

				<listitem><para>Usage of Revision Control for Debian package</para>
					
					<para>If you use svn (<application>svn-buildpackage</application>) to
						handle your Debian package, you usually don't store the original
						tarball inside. If someone else does a checkout, he'll need to
						get the original tarball separately. Other revision control
						systems can be used to track only the packaging files
						(<filename>debian/</filename>, etc.) and not the whole
						source. However, if the .orig.tar.gz is not the same, then
						obviously problems can occur.</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para>Security tracking</para>

					<para>Consider a situation where someone <emphasis>wants</emphasis> to
							introduce a backdoor/rootkit or other evil stuff. If the original
							tarball is intact, it can be scanned easily through the .diff.gz to
							see if the person who modified the package tried to do something evil.
							If the tarball has changed, however, you also need to check the
							differences between the tarball and the original source.</para>
		
						<note><para>You still have to trust the authors of the software 
								not to do anything evil, but that is the case regardless of
								whether the original is changed.</para></note></listitem>

				<listitem><para>The .diff.gz</para>
						
					<para>The option to use the .diff.gz to reflect changes to the
						original tarball already exists, so it is easy to make changes
						without touching the original tarball.</para></listitem>
				
			</orderedlist>

			<note><para>It is always a good idea to contact the program's author(s) and ask

					Software Foundation address in COPYRIGHT files, or other things that

					you do not need to "patch" the source in .diff.gz.</para></note>
