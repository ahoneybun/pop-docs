 		<title>Updating Packages</title>

			<para>If you have been around Linux distributions for any amount
				of time, you have realized that there are sometimes bugs in
				programs. In the Debian and <phrase>Ubuntu</phrase> distributions, bugs are
				often fixed through the packaging by patching the source code.
				Sometimes there are bugs in the packaging itself that can
				cause difficulties.</para>

			<para>To patch the program's source code, you could simply download
				the current <phrase>Ubuntu</phrase> source package (with
				<application>apt-get source</application>) and make the needed
				changes. You can then add a new entry to the
				<filename>debian/changelog</filename> using
				<application>dch -i</application> or
				<application>dch -v
					&lt;version&gt;-&lt;revision&gt;</application> to specify
				the new revision. When you run <application>debuild
					-S</application> from the source directory you will have a
				new source package with a new <filename>.diff.gz</filename> in the
				parent directory that
				contains your changes. A problem with this approach is that
				the distinction between source and patches is unclear.</para>

			<para>A solution to this problem is to separate the changes to the source code into individual patches stored in the <filename>debian</filename> directory. One such patch system is called <application>dpatch</application>. The patches are stored in the <filename>debian/patches/</filename> directory and have a special format.</para>

			<para>To create a <application>dpatch</application>, perform the following steps sequentially.</para>

			<para>Create a temporary work space and two copies of the current source directory:</para>
			
			<screen>
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
cp -a ../&lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt; . 
cp -a &lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt; &lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.orig 
</screen>

			<para>Make the changes in the <filename>&lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</filename> directory.</para>

			<para>Create a patch file using <application>diff</application> and place it in the <filename>debian/patches</filename> directory:</para>

			<screen>
diff -Nru  &lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.orig &lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt; &gt; patch-file
</screen>

			<para>Create the <application>dpatch</application> using <application>dpatch patch-template</application> and a file named <filename>00list</filename> that lists the dpatches:</para>
			<screen>
dpatch patch-template -p "01_patchname" "patch-file description" \
	&lt; patch-file &gt; 01_patchname.dpatch
echo 01_patchname.dpatch &gt;00list</screen>

			<para>You can now place <filename>01_patchname.dpatch</filename> and <filename>00list</filename> in the <filename>debian/patches</filename> directory of your source package:</para>

			<screen>
mkdir ../&lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt;/debian/patches
cp 01_patchname.dpatch 00list ../&lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt;/debian/patches
cd ..
rm -rf tmp
			</screen>

			<note><para>You can also edit a pre-existing patch using <application>dpatch-edit-patch</application>.</para></note>
			
		<para>Once all the changes have been made, a changelog entry added, and <application>dpatch</application> added to the <filename>debian/control</filename> file (if needed), then you can rebuild the source package with <application>debuild -S</application>.</para>

		<para>To get your fixed source package uploaded to the <phrase>Ubuntu</phrase>
			repositories, you will need to get your source package sponsored by
			a person who has upload rights. See <xref linkend="ubuntu-upload"/> for more details. Sometimes, rather
			than giving the entire source package (.diff.gz, .dsc, and
			.orig.tar.gz), it is easier and more efficient to just give the
			difference between the source package that is currently in the
			repositories and your fixed source package. A tool has been
			created to do just that called
			<application>debdiff</application>. Using
			<application>debdiff</application> is similar to using
			<application>diff</application> but is made specifically for
			packaging. You can <application>debdiff</application> the
			source package by:</para>

		<screen>
debdiff &lt;oldpackage&gt;.dsc &lt;newpackage&gt;.dsc &gt; package.debdiff
		</screen>

		<para>or the binary package by:</para>

		<screen>
debdiff &lt;oldpackage&gt;.deb &lt;newpackage&gt;.deb &gt; package.debdiff
		</screen>
	
		<para>Debdiffs are great to attach to bug reports and have ready for a sponsor to upload.</para>
