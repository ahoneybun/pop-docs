#. This could use some work for 3.2. There are some less drastic things.
#. Like if there's another admin user on your computer, have them reset
#. your password in the user accounts settings.</p>
#. <p>Also: merge two grubs instructions (almost equal), use clicky-clicky
#. instructions as much as possible, and let's get some real keyring docs
