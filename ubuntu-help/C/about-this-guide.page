<title>About this guide</title>
<p>This guide gives you a tour of your desktop features, answers your computer-related questions, and provides tips on using your computer more effectively. We've tried to make it as easy to use as possible:</p>

<list>
  <item><p>The guide is divided into small, task-oriented topics--not chapters. This means that you don't need to skim through an entire manual to find answers to your questions.</p></item>
  <item><p>Related items are linked together. "See Also" links at the bottom of some pages direct you to related topics.</p></item>
  <item><p>There is a built-in search. The bar at the top of the help browser is a <em>search bar</em>, and relevant results will start appearing as soon as you start typing.</p></item>
  <item><p>The guide is constantly being improved. Although we attempt to provide you with a comprehensive collection of helpful information, we know we won't answer all of your questions here. We will keep adding more information to make things more helpful, though.</p></item>
