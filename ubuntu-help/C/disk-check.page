 <title>Checking the hard disk</title>
  <p>Hard disks have a built-in health-check tool called <app>SMART</app>
 (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology), which continually
 checks the disk for potential problems. SMART also warns you if the disk
 is about to fail, helping you avoid loss of important data.</p>

  <p>Although SMART runs automatically, you can also check your disk's
 health by running the <app>Disks</app> application:</p>

<steps>
 <title>Check your disk's health using the Disks application</title>

 <item>
<if:choose>
<if:when test="platform:unity">
  <p>Open the <app>Disks</app> application from the <gui>Dash</gui>.</p>
</if:when>
  <p>Open the <app>Disks</app> application from the <gui>Activities</gui>
  overview.</p>
</if:choose>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>From the list to the left, select the disk whose information and status
  you want to check.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p><gui>Assessment</gui> should say "Disk is OK".</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>Click the menu button and select <gui>SMART Data &amp;
  Self-Tests</gui> to view more drive information, or to run a self-test.</p>
 </item>

 <title>What if the disk isn't healthy?</title>

  <p>Even if the <gui>SMART Assessment</gui> indicates that the disk <em>isn't</em>
 entirely healthy, there may be no cause for alarm. However, it's better to be prepared
 with a <link xref="backup-why">backup</link> to prevent data loss.</p>

  <p>If the status of one or more of the health checks is "Pre-Fail", the disk is still reasonably healthy but
 signs of wear have been detected, which mean the disk might fail in the near future.
 If your disk (or computer) is a few years old, you are likely to see
 this status on some of the health checks. You should
 <link xref="backup-how">backup your important files regularly</link> and check
 the disk periodically to see if it gets worse.</p>

  <p>If it gets worse, you may wish to take the computer/hard disk to a
 professional for further diagnosis or repair.</p>
