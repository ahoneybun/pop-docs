 <title>Checking the hard disk</title>
<p>Hard disks have a built-in health-check called <em>SMART</em>. This continually checks for potential problems, and can warn you if the disk is about to fail. This is useful for avoiding future loss of important data.</p>
<p>To check your disk's health status:</p>
<steps>
 <item>
  <p>Click the <gui>dash</gui> in the top left corner of the screen and start the <app>Disk Utility</app>.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>Select your hard drive in the <gui>Storage Devices</gui> list. Information will appear about the disk and its status under <gui>Drive</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p><gui>SMART Status</gui> should say "Disk is healthy".</p>
 </item> 
 <item>
  <p>To see details of the data and tests applied, click on the <gui>SMART Data</gui> button located below <gui>SMART Status</gui>.</p>
 </item>
</steps>

 <title>What if the disk isn't healthy?</title>
 <p>Even if the <gui>SMART Status</gui> indicates that the disk <em>isn't</em> healthy, there may be no cause for alarm. However, it's better to be prepared with a <link xref="backup-why">backup</link> to prevent data loss. You may wish to take the computer/hard disk to a professional for further diagnosis and repair.</p>
 <p>If the status says "Pre-fail", the disk is still reasonably healthy but signs of wear have been detected which mean it might fail in the near future. If your hard disk (or computer) is a few years old, you are likely to see this message on at least some of the health checks. You should <link xref="backup-how">backup your important files regularly</link> and check the disk status periodically to see if it gets worse.</p>
