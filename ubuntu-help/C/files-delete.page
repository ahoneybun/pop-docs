<title>Delete files and folders</title>

<p>
If you don't want a file or folder any more, you can delete it.
</p>

<p>
When you delete an item it is moved to the Trash folder, where it is stored until you empty the trash.  Items stored in the Trash folder can be restored to their original location if you decide you need them, or if they were accidentally deleted.
</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Select the item you want to delete by clicking it once.</p></item>
  <item><p>Press <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Delete</key></keyseq> on your keyboard.
  Alternatively, drag the item to the <gui>Trash</gui> in the sidebar.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>To delete files permanently, and to free up disk space on your
computer, you need to empty the trash. To empty the trash, right-click
<gui>Trash</gui> in the sidebar and select <gui>Empty Trash</gui>.
Alternatively, you can permanently delete individual items in the
trash by navigating to the trash from the sidebar or the
<gui>Go</gui> menu. Select files you want to delete permanently and press
<keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Delete</key></keyseq> on your keyboard, or
right-click and select <gui>Delete Permanently</gui>.</p>

<note><p>If you move files to the trash on a removable device
such as a USB flash drive and do not empty the trash when you
<link xref="files-removedrive">remove the device</link>, you may
not be able to see the deleted files in the trash on other
operating systems, such as Windows or Mac OS. The files are
still there, and will be available when you plug the device
back into your computer.</p></note>

 <title>Permanently delete a file</title>
<p>You can immediately delete a file permanently, without having to
send it to the trash first.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Select the item you want to delete.</p></item>
  <item><p>Press and hold the <gui>Shift</gui> key, then press the <key>Delete</key> key on your keyboard.</p></item>
  <item><p>Because you cannot undo this, you will be asked to
  confirm that you want to delete the file or folder.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>If you frequently need to delete files without using the trash
(for example, if you often work with sensitive data), you can add
a <gui>Delete</gui> entry to the right-click menu for files and
folders. Click <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Preferences</gui></guiseq>
and select the <gui>Behavior</gui> tab. Select <gui>Include a Delete
command that bypasses Trash</gui>.</p>
