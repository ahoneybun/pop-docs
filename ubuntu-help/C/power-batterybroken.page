<title>Why does it say my battery is broken?</title>

<p>When you first log in, you might see a message that says:</p>
<quote>
 <p><em>Battery may be broken. Your battery has a very low capacity which means that it may be old or broken.</em></p>
</quote>

<p>This message is displayed when the computer detects that your battery is not capable of storing much charge. The most likely reason for this is that your battery is old; it's probably not broken, so there's no need to worry.</p>

<p>Over time, all laptop batteries lose their ability to store charge. After a while (normally a year or more), the battery will only be able to store a fraction of the charge that it could when it was new. The message above is shown when this happens.</p>

<p>If your computer/battery is relatively new, it should be capable of holding a high percentage of its design charge. If it can't, then your battery may be broken and you might need to seek a replacement.</p>
