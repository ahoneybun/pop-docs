  <title>Check your backup</title>
  <p>
    After you have backed up your files, you should make sure that the backup was successful.  
   </p>
   <p>
   A file integrity check is not done on a copy/move operation.  This means if you are copying files to other drives/media, it is not easy to verify data integrity or to single out files that have failed. 
   </p>
    <p>
    You can do a check by looking through the copied files and directories in the destination media. By opening and checking the copied files, you can see whether the files you check copied successfully.
    </p>
    
    <note style="tip"><p>If you find that you do regular backups of large amounts of data, you may find it easier to use a dedicated backup program, such as <app>Déjà Dup</app>. Such a program is more powerful and more reliable than just copying and pasting data.</p></note>
