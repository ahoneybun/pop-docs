  <title>Log in with a fingerprint</title>
  <p>If your system has a supported fingerprint scanner, you can record your fingerprint and use it to log in. You must have administrative privileges to perform these steps.</p>
  <p>First, record a fingerprint the system can use to identify you.</p>
  <note style="tip">
    <p>If your finger is too dry, you may have difficulty registering your fingerprint. If this happens, moisten your finger slightly, dry it with a clean, lint-free cloth, and retry.</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Select your user name in the upper right-hand corner, then choose "My Account".</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Unlock your account using the "Unlock" button at the bottom left of the User Accounts tool.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Enter your password at the prompt.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select the "Disabled" option next to "Fingerprint Login".</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select an option for the fingerprint you want to register. You may choose your right index finger, your left index finger, or a different finger. Then select "Forward".</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Swipe the finger you selected three times at moderate speed over your fingerprint reader. Each time the fingerprint reader recognizes your fingerprint properly, the corresponding picture of a hand will transform into a picture of a fingerprint with a check mark. After the third swipe, you will see the message "Done!"</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select "Forward". You will see a confirmation message that your fingerprint was saved successfully. Select "Close" to finish.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>
  <p>Now check that your new fingerprint login works. If you register a fingerprint, you still have the option to log in with your password.</p>
  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Save any open work, and then log out. Select your name in the upper right-hand corner and then select "Log Out...".</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>A confirmation message will appear. Select "Log Out" to confirm. The login screen appears.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>At the login screen, select your user name from the list. The password entry form will appear.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Within 30 seconds, select the fingerprint button above and to the right of your name.</p>
      <note>
	<p>The fingerprint button is labeled with a picture of a hand. If the timer runs out, the button will disappear and you will only be permitted to log in with a password. If you want to try again, select the "Cancel" button and return to the previous step.</p>
      </note>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Swipe the finger you registered over your fingerprint scanner. You will be logged in.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>
  <p>If you previously created a login keyring, it is secured by your password. To unlock it, enter your password.</p>
