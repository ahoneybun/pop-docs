  <title>File properties</title>

  <p>You can view information about a file in the file properties dialog.
  To view the properties for a file or folder, right-click it and select
  <gui>Properties</gui>. You can also select the file and press
  <guiseq><gui>Alt</gui><gui>Enter</gui></guiseq>.</p>

  <p>The file properties dialog shows you information like the file type,
  size, and modification time. If you need this information often, you
  can have it displayed in <link xref="nautilus-list">list view columns</link>
  or <link xref="nautilus-display#icon-captions">icon captions</link>.</p>

  <p>The file properties dialog also allow you to
  <link xref="nautilus-file-properties-permissions">set file permissions</link>
  and <link xref="files-open">choose applications to open files</link>.</p>

  <p>For certain types of files, such as images and videos, there will be
  an extra tab that provides information like the dimensions, duration,
  and codec.</p>

  <!--COMMENT
    <cite date="2011-04-04">shaunm</cite>
    <p>This page is intentionally written to give you some overview of
    the other tabs, because I happen to know that in 3.0 it's the target
    of the Help button in the properties dialog, regardless of the tab
    you're on.</p>
