<title>Notifications and the Messaging Tray</title>

<section id="what">
<title>What's a notification?</title>
<p>If an application or a system component wants to get your attention, a notification will be shown at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>For example, if you get a new chat message, new updates are available for your computer, or your computerâ€™s battery is low, you will get a notification informing you about that.</p>
<p>The notification will first appear as a single line, so as to be least distracting. You can move your mouse over it if you want to see its full content.</p>

<title>The Messaging Tray</title>
<p>The Messaging Tray gives you a way to get back to your notifications when it is convenient for you. It appears when you move your mouse to the bottom right corner of the screen and contains all the notifications that you have not acted upon or that permanently reside in it.</p>
<p>You can view the notifications by clicking on the Messaging Tray items. The items in the Messaging Tray are usually applications that sent you notifications. However, chat notifications are given a special treatment and are represented by the individual contacts who sent you the chat messages.</p>
<p>The Messaging Tray is always visible in the Activities Overview.</p>
