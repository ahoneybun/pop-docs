<title>Browse files and folders</title>

<comment>
	<p>This page is a feature overview. There should be a greater visual
	separation between features. Small illustrative figures should be used
	to display these features where appropriate, and video demonstrations of
	some of the features might be useful too. Explain how you can add things to
	the sidebar (link to a topic or explain it here).</p>

<p>Use the <app>Files</app> file manager to browse and organize the files and folders on
your computer. You can also use it to manage files and folders on storage devices (like
external hard disks), on <link xref="nautilus-connect">file servers</link>, and
on network shares.</p>

<p>To start the file manager, open <app>Files</app> in the <gui>Launcher</gui>.
You can also search for files and folders with the <gui>Dash</gui> in the
same way you would <link xref="unity-dash-intro#dash-home">search
for applications</link>. They will appear under the heading
<gui>Files and Folders</gui>.</p>

<section id="files-view-folder-contents">
  <title>Exploring the contents of folders</title>

<p>In the file manager by default:</p>

<list type="disc">

<item><p>Double-click a folder to view its contents, and</p></item>

<item><p>Double-click a file to open it with the default application for
that file (if there is one).</p></item> 

</list>

<p>You can also right-click a folder to open it in a new tab
or new window.</p>

<p>The <em>path bar</em> above the list of files and folders shows you which
folder you're viewing, including the parent folders of the current folder.
Click a parent folder in the path bar to go to that folder. Right-click any
folder in the path bar to open it in a new tab or window, copy or move it, or
access its properties.</p>

<p>To quickly skip to a file in the folder you're viewing:</p>

<steps>

<item><p>Start typing the file name. A search box will appear at the bottom of the window and
the first file that matches your search will be highlighted.</p></item> 

<item><p>Press the down or up arrow keys, or scroll with the mouse, to cycle through the files that match
your search.</p></item>

</steps>

<p>You can quickly access commonly-used locations from the <em>sidebar</em>. If you do
not see the sidebar, click the <gui>Files</gui> menu and select <gui>Sidebar</gui>. 
You can add <link xref="nautilus-bookmarks-edit">bookmarks</link>
in the sidebar in order to navigate quickly to folders.</p>
