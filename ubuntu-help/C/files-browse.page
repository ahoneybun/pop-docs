<title>Browse files and folders</title>

<p>Use the <app>Files</app> application to browse the files in
your home folder, on external devices, on
<link xref="nautilus-connect">file servers</link>, and across
your computer's file system.</p>

 <title>How do I open the file manager?</title>

 <item><p>Search for files and folders in
the <gui>dash</gui> the same way you would <link xref="unity-dash-intro#dash-global-search">search
for applications</link>. They will appear under the heading
<gui>Files and Folders</gui>.</p></item>

 <item><p>Another way to open the file manager is to select the <app>Home Folder</app> shortcut in the
launcher.</p></item>

</list></note>

<p>In the file manager, double-click any folder to view its contents,
and double-click any file to open it with the default application for
that file. You can also right-click a folder to open it in a new tab
or new window. In list view, you can also click the expander next to
a folder to show its contents in a tree.</p>

<p>The path bar above the list of files and folders shows you which
folder you're viewing, including the parent folders up to your home
directory, the root of a removable device, or the root of your file
system. Click a parent folder in the path bar to go to that folder.
Right-click any folder in the path bar to open it in a new tab or
window, copy or move it, or access its properties.</p>

<p>You can quickly access common places from the side pane. If you do
not see the side pane, click <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Side Pane</gui></guiseq>.
 You can add bookmarks to folders
you use often, and they will appear in the side pane.</p>

<p>If you frequently move files between nested folders, you might
find it more useful to show a tree in the side pane instead. Click
<gui>Places</gui> in the side pane and then select <gui>Tree</gui> in the dropdown list 
to enable the tree side pane. Click the expander next to a folder to
show its child folders in the tree, or click a folder to open it
in the window.</p>
