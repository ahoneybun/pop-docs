  <p>The <gui>Dash</gui> allows you to search for applications, files, music, and videos,
    and shows you items that you have used recently. If you have ever worked on
    a spreadsheet or edited an
    image and forgot where you saved it, you will surely find this feature of the dash to be useful.
  </p>

  <p>To start using the <gui>dash</gui>, click the top icon in the <link xref="unity-launcher-intro">launcher</link>.

  <p>The first thing you'll see when opening the dash is the Dash Home. Without typing
    or clicking anything, the dash home will show you apps and files you've used recently.</p>
  <p>Only one row of results will show for each type. If there are more results, you can
    click <gui>See more results</gui> to view them.</p>

  <p>To search, just start typing and related search results will automatically appear
    from the different installed lenses.</p>

  <p>Click on a result to open it, or you can press <key>Enter</key> to open the first
    item in the list.</p>

  <p>Lenses allow you to focus the dash results and exclude results from other lenses.</p>

  <p>You can see the available lenses in the <gui>lens bar</gui>, the darker strip at
    the bottom of the dash.</p>

  <p>To switch to a different lens, click the appropriate icon or press
    <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq>.</p>

    filter heading such as <gui>Sources</gui> to see the available choices.</p>

</section>

<section id="dash-previews">
  <title>Previews</title>

  <p>If you right click on a search result, a <gui>preview</gui> will open with more
    information about the result.</p>
