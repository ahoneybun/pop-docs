END COMMENT -->

<p>Here is how to connect to a wireless network:</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>If you have a wireless hardware switch on your computer, make sure that it is turned on.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click the <gui>network menu</gui> in the <gui>top panel</gui>, and look for your desired network.</p>
    <steps>
      <item><p>Select the name of your wireless network.</p></item>
      <item><p>If the name of your wireless network isn't in the list, click <gui>More Networks</gui> 
to see additional network names.</p></item>
    </steps>
  </item>
  <item><p>If the network is protected by a password or encryption key, you will be asked for a <gui>Key</gui>. Enter the password or encryption key, and click <gui>Connect</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>The network icon will change appearance as the computer attempts to connect to the network.</p></item>
</steps>
 
<p>If the connection is successful, the icon will change to a dot with several bars above it. More bars indicate a stronger connection to the network. Fewer bars indicate a weaker connection to the network.</p>

<note><p>A stronger connection to the network does not necessarily mean that you have a faster internet connection, or that you will have faster download speeds.</p></note>

<note><p>Connecting to a wireless network is easy in most cases, but there can sometimes be problems.</p>
<p>If you experience any trouble with accessing your network, visit some of the other networking-related help topics by clicking on one of the "See Also" links at the bottom of this page.</p></note>
