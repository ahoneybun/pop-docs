<title>Quickly preview music/sound files</title>

<p>Move your mouse pointer over a music file (or other sound file). A musical note icon will appear and the song will start playing. Move the mouse away from the file and the song will stop playing.</p>

<p>Only music files which are in a supported format can be played in this way. </p>

<p>Music files on network shares cannot be previewed in this way by default.
To change this, see <link xref="nautilus-preview"/>.</p>
