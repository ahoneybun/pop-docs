  <title>Why are there shopping links in the Dash?</title>

<p>In addition to helping you find apps or files on your computer, the <gui>Dash</gui>
also shows you related online results for your searches. Online sources include
Amazon.com and the Ubuntu One Music Store and more online sources will be added.</p>

<p>When you purchase music or products from these sources, Canonical receives a
  small portion of the profits in exchange for directing more business to these stores.
  Canonical, the company that created and continues to support the Ubuntu project,
  then uses this money to make Ubuntu better.</p>
