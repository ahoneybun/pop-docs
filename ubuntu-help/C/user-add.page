  <title>Add a new user account</title>

  <p>You can add multiple user accounts to your computer. Give one account
  to each person in your household or company. Every user has their own
  home folder, documents, and settings.</p>

<steps>
    <item><p>Click the icon at the very right of the panel and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>In the <em>System</em> section, click <gui>Users and Groups</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>In the list of accounts on the left, click the <gui>Add</gui> button
  to add a new user account. Type your password to make changes. You must be an 
  administrative user to add user accounts.</p></item>
  <item><p>Enter the new user's full name. The username will be filled in automatically
  based on the full name. The default is probably OK, but you can change it if you
  like. Click <gui>OK</gui> when you're done.</p></item>
  <item><p>The account is initially disabled until you choose what to do about
  the user's password. Have the user type their password
  in the <gui>New password</gui> and <gui>Confirmation</gui> fields. See
  <link xref="user-goodpassword"/>. You can also click the button next to the
  <gui>Generate random password</gui> field to select a randomly generated secure password. These
  passwords are hard for others to guess, but they can be hard to remember, so
  be careful.</p></item>

  <item><p>New users are created without <link xref="user-admin-explain">administrative privileges</link>. 
  If you want the new user to have administrative access to the computer,
  select <gui>Administrator</gui> for the account type. Administrators can do things
  like add and delete users, install software and drivers, and change the date and
  time.</p></item>
