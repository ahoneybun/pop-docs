Description: Ubuntu Desktop Guide
 This package holds the official Ubuntu-specific documentation, maintained
 by the Ubuntu Documentation Team. The documentation can be viewed using
 Yelp, the GNOME help browser.
 .
 This package recommends gnome-user-docs, which provides the bulk of the
 Ubuntu Desktop Guide, and ubuntu-docs does not make much sense without it.
