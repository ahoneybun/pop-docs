Ubuntu-docs
===========

When hacking this package, it is important to test:

o yelp ghelp:about-ubuntu (localised)
o Firefox and Epiphany start page - with CSS and Ubuntu logo
o yelp front page has About Ubuntu and Faqguide (and pages it connects to
  are localised, and have pictures)
o No scrollkeeper-update errors

When building the package, we do this command to filter out unwanted folders from the source package (see the list in README.Debian):

svn export https://docteam.ubuntu.com/repos/trunk/; cd trunk; grep -E ^"\*" debian/README.Debian | sed 's/^\*\ //' | xargs rm -rf
