= This folder contains files for building pdfs of the Ubuntu Documentation =

In order to build pdfs you need to install:
 * java - install the sun jre/jdk.
 * apache fop - http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/
 * an image library such as jimi -  http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/

To build pdfs with embedded fonts, pass the configuration file in this folder to fop using the -c flag. To build without embedding fonts, omit this.
