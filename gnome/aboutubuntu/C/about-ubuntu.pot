In many ways it's a tiny part of the whole mix, but its role is so important that many people describe the whole desktop as \"Linux\". Linux is the software which has come to define the worldwide movement to embrace free software. There is another project, called GNU, which set out to create a free operating system before Linux did, and today we use the Linux kernel together with many of the GNU applications. That's why we call Ubuntu an example of GNU/Linux software. Find out about GNU/Linux at <ulink url=\"http://www.linux.org/\">www.linux.org</ulink>."
