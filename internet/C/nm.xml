	<para>
	Use the Network Manager applet in the top panel to set up your network 
	and Internet connections. It will change its appearance depending on 
	what sort of connection you have; it might look like a wireless antenna 
	or two arrows, for example. Look near the clock to find it.
	</para>

	If you want to connect to a network, left-click the Network Manager 
	icon and choose a network from the list.

	<para>
	If you don't see a network on the list, or want to view or change some
