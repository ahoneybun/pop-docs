				<para>Many people these days use multiple computers. They might have a desktop at their office as well as a laptop for traveling or just going to a coffee shop. Ensuring that all of your files are accessible no matter what computer you are using is quite a difficult task. The same could be said for the complexity of keeping your Evolution address book, Tomboy notes, or Firefox bookmarks in sync.</para>
				<para>This is where <application>Ubuntu One</application> helps - it keeps your digital life in sync. All of your documents, music, bookmarks, address book contacts, and notes stay in sync across all of your computers. In addition, they are all stored in your personal online cloud so you can use a web browser from any computer to access all of your files from the <ulink url="http://one.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu One website</ulink>.</para>
				<para><application>Ubuntu One</application> provides all Ubuntu users with 2 GB of storage for free.
