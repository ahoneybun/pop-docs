  <h1>Using Kubuntu</h1>

  <p>The Kubuntu project strives to take the best of Ubuntu and the
  best of the K Desktop Environment (KDE) to produce a great Linux
  distribution. This chapter will cover information ranging from
  what exactly Kubuntu is to how to manage and keep your Kubuntu
  system up-to-date with the latest applications and fixes. The
  goal of Kubuntu is to provide a great Linux operating system (OS)
  that provides a simple and easy-to-use OS through great graphical
  tools and an OS that is easy to customize to your desire.</p>

  <h2>Introduction to Kubuntu</h2>

  <p>Kubuntu is an official project of Ubuntu&mdash;a complete
  implementation of the Ubuntu OS led by Jonathan Riddell (an
  employee of Canonical Ltd.) and an army of developers. However,
  Kubuntu uses KDE instead of GNOME for Ubuntu. The main goal of
  Kubuntu is to be a great integrated Linux distribution with all
  of the great features of Ubuntu, but based on KDE. Since Kubuntu
  is an official part of the Ubuntu community it adheres to the
  same Ubuntu manifesto: Great software should be available free of
  charge and should be usable by people in their own language
  regardless of disability. Also, people should be able to
  customize and alter their software in ways they deem fit.</p>

  <p>Like Ubuntu, Kubuntu makes the following commitments: the very
  best translations and accessibility infrastructure that the free
  software community has to offer; Kubuntu will always be free of
  charge, and there is no extra cost for an
  &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; version;, and Kubuntu will always
  provide the latest and best software from the KDE community.</p>

  <p>Looking for a certain piece of software? Kubuntu has it, with
  more then 1,000 pieces of software in its repositories including
  the latest kernel version and, of course, the latest KDE, which
  at the time of this writing is at version 3.5.2. The standard
  desktop applications (Web browsing, e-mail, word processing, and
  spreadsheet applications) allow Kubuntu to replace any current
  desktop OS. If you are running servers, whether it is a Web
  server, e-mail server, or database server, Kubuntu can do that as
  well.</p>

  <h3>History of KDE</h3>

  <p>In 1996, Matthias Ettrich posted a now famous newsgroup post
  that described some of the problems that he had with the UNIX
  Desktop.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;UNIX popularity grows thanks to the free variants,
  mostly Linux. But still a consistent, nice looking, free desktop
  environment is missing. There are several nice either free or
  low-priced applications available, so that Linux/X11 would almost
  fit everybody&rsquo;s needs if we could offer a real GUI...</p>

  <p>IMHO a GUI should offer a complete graphical environment. It
  should allow a user to do his everyday tasks with it, like
  starting applications, reading mail, configuring his dekstop...
  All parts must fit together and work together....</p>

  <p>The goal is NOT to create a GUI for the complete UNIX-system
  or the System-Administrator... The idea is to create a GUI for an
  ENDUSER.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With this post he started building the KDE Project. KDE
  originally stood for Kool Desktop Enviroment but later was
  adapted to be K Desktop Enviroment. The mascot for KDE is a green
  dragon named Konqi, who can be found in various applications.</p>

  <p>Matthias chose to develop KDE around the QT Toolkit, and by
  1997 the first large complex applications were being released. In
  1998, version 1.0 was released. However, there was much debate
  based on the fact that QT was not licensed around a free software
  license. Two projects came about from this debate, one named
  &ldquo;Harmony&rdquo; which would only use free libraries and
  another project called GNOME. In 1998, the QT toolkit was
  licensed under a new Open Source license called the Q Public
  License (QPL), and in 2000 QT was released under the Gnu General
  Public License (GPL).</p>

  <p>KDE is primarily a volunteer effort. However, many companies
  employ developers to work on this project. Some of these
  companies include Novell (through the purchase of SUSE Linux),
  Trolltech (the company that produces the QT toolkit), and many
  others.</p>

  <p>At the time of this writing the current version of KDE is
  3.5.2 .&nbsp; The next major release of KDE will be version 4 and
  will include many changes. For more information on KDE visit the
  project&rsquo;s Web site at www.kde.org. The project&rsquo;s
  homepage also provides information on how you can help out with
  the project and contribute back to the KDE community.</p>

  <h3>History of Kubuntu</h3>

  <p>When Ubuntu was first being discussed there were rumors that
  it would be only based on GNOME, and KDE would be left out.
  Jonathan Riddell, a KDE developer, posted an article on his Web
  log (blog) that soon became the No. 1 hit on Google for Ubuntu
  Linux. The article states:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The signs are there that this could be something big,
  more so than the likes of Linspire, Xandros, or Lycrosis. Unlike
  those companies, they [Canonical Ltd. Software] understand Free
  Software and open development. It is likely to be a GNOME-based
  job, but maybe there is a KDE developer out there who is working
  for them without letting on. If not I&rsquo;m always
  available.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This post started a flurry of activity both for Riddell and
  the others who wanted to participate.</p>

  <p>A lot of changes needed to be made to get Kubuntu working
  correctly. A hardware-accessible library needed to be changed.
  Programs and packages needed to be created, along with a clean
  K-menu changed to fit the philosophy of Ubuntu. And along the way
  more people needed to join the project. It was a conscious
  decision to keep the default KDE colors and icons in order to
  remain as close to KDE as possible.</p>

  <p>Once a preview release of Ubuntu (Hoary Hedgehog) came out,
  another flurry of activity ensued that had developers uploading
  last minute changes&mdash;including some that broke almost
  everything they had set up&mdash;and the first CDs were released.
  Since this initial release Kubuntu has grown and changed. New
  items in the Breezy (5.10) release included system settings,
  automatic mounting when inserting a USB drive, and, of course,
  the latest KDE. In the next release, Dapper Drake (6.04), there
  are almost the same numbers of changes the latest version of KDE
  (version 3.5.2) along with featuring the addition of zerconf
  discovery, a new installer, Katapult enabled by default, and CJK
  (Chinese Japanese, and Korean Language) support.</p>

  <p>Kubuntu is quickly building up a sizable community of its own.
  Not only are there new package managers and a dedicated
  documentation team, but also many community and fan sites to help
  provide support and the most current information. Kubuntu has
  grown tremendously from just one developer to a large group as it
  continues to improve the quality of the distribution.</p>

  <h3>Navigating in Kubuntu</h3>

  <p>All of the applications in Kubuntu are stored in the K menu in
  the left-hand bottom corner of the task bar. This menu is
  organized in a manner that flows smoothly and makes sense. Items
  that involve a connection to the Internet are grouped under the
  Internet section while items that deal with music, videos, or
  pictures are grouped under Multimedia. Like everything else, this
  can be customized or changed to fit your needs. This will be
  discussed later. Any new application installed will find its
  appropriate spot in the K menu.</p>

  <h4>Katapult</h4>

  <p>Katapult is a great application that is enabled by default
  that will help you navigate Kubuntu. This handy program will
  change your computing ways. This is the one program you will miss
  the most if you ever need to return to the Windows world.
  Katapult is an application that can launch programs without the
  need for a shortcut or maneuvering through the K menu. Simply hit
  Alt-Space, and Katapult will launch. To run an application,
  simply start typing the name of the program, and Katapult will
  use tab-completion to fill in the rest of the name. A great
  feature is that Katapult will also work on files that are stored
  in the root of your home directory. Figure 7-1 shows Katapult in
  action.</p>

  <img src="7-1katapult.png" />

  <p>Katapult provides an easy way to open just about any
  application without wasting time searching for its location in
  the K menu.</p>

  <p>The next three icons on the task bar are shortcuts to the
  System Menu, Konqueror, and Kontact. The system menu allows you
  to navigate quickly to places such as your home directory, a
  listing of attached media devices, and even remote places. The
  Konqueror shortcut launches the default file management tool. We
  cover this in more detail later in the chapter. Kontact is the
  default Personal Information Manager (PIM) and will be discussed
  later on as well. To further emphasize the clean look of Kubuntu,
  there are no icons on the desktop, as Figure 7-2 shows.</p>

<img src="7-2desktop.png" />

  <p>The clean look of the Kubuntu desktop</p>

  <p>The developers have spent a lot of time making Kubuntu easy to
  navigate and also very easy to customize.</p>

  <h3>Shutting Your Computer Down and Logging Out</h3>

  <p>To shut your computer down, log out, or switch users go to the
  K menu, and then select the option you would like. Kubuntu is a
  multiuser (many users per system) OS. You can either lock your
  session and switch to a new user or just start a new session. The
  other option is to lock the session so no one else can access
  your Kubuntu session without the password. The final choice at
  the bottom of the K menu is to End the Current Session.</p>

  <p>Ending a session is the location you would choose to either
  turn off your computer, reboot, or end the current session (log
  out). See Figure 7-3 that depicts these options.</p>

<!--<img src="" />
  <p>Figure 7-3</p>-->

  <p>Logging out of Kubuntu</p>

  <h2>Installing Kubuntu</h2>

  <p>Installing Kubuntu is just like installing Ubuntu. It is
  pretty much a snap. Let&rsquo;s start with where you find it.</p>

  <h3>Where to Find Kubuntu</h3>

  <p>Kubuntu is available at the same location as Ubuntu,
  www.kubuntu.org/download.php. An image file can be downloaded and
  then burned onto either a DVD or a CD-ROM. There are two
  different types of Kubuntu images that can be downloaded and
  used. The first is the Deskto CD that allows the user to test and
  run Kubuntu without changing any settings. The second is the
  actual installer.</p>

  <p>New to Kubuntu 6.06, theDesktop CD will come with an installer
  so you will not have to download a separate version if everything
  tests successfully. A good way to demonstrate the power of
  Kubuntu is to show it off with the live CD, and when your friends
  like it install it for them.</p>

  <p>Another way to get Kubuntu would be through ordering the free
  CD from Ubuntu (shipit.ubuntu.com). The beauty of this is there
  is no cost for shipping and handling, and you will then have an
  official CD complete with cover art and everything. This is also
  great for user groups or install parties were a group of people
  will be using Kubuntu.</p>

  <h3>Can I Switch to Kubuntu If I Have Ubuntu Installed
  Already?</h3>

  <p>If you have installed Ubuntu on your system already, it is
  extremely easy to install and configure Kubuntu. In Synaptic,
  find the package Kubuntu-desktop, which will provide all the
  necessary programs to have your system look and act like Kubuntu.
  Don&rsquo;t worry. You can still switch between Ubuntu with GNOME
  as the desktop manager and Kubuntu with KDE as the desktop
  environment. Once Kubuntu is installed, one can choose which
  desktop environment to use, either GNOME or KDE. Also if you wish
  to have Ubuntu, it is simple to switch, just install
  Ubuntu-desktop and you will be using the GNOME desktop.</p>

  <p>Once you have installed the Kubuntu-desktop, end your GNOME
  session and choose Session from the menu. Select KDE instead of
  GNOME as your window manager, and then select Make Default. From
  now on KDE will start for you when you sign on.</p>

  <h3>Guided Installation</h3>

  <p>Kubuntu follows the easy-to-use Ubuntu installer to set up and
  configure your system. Like Ubuntu, there is more than one way to
  install a new copy, including Expert and Normal modes. New to
  this version of Kubuntu is a way to rescue a broken system and
  get it up and working again. The Normal install, which is the
  easiest and most used, asks several basic questions such as host
  name, how the network is configured, username and password, and
  how the drives will be formatted. Once these questions are
  answered, the system will proceed with formatting your hard drive
  and installing Kubuntu. After logging in for the first time the
  next step will be to make sure your system is up-to-date
  including any bug fixes or security patches. This is done through
  Adept, which is discussed later in this chapter.</p>

  <h3>Installing from the Live CD</h3>

  <p>New to this version of Kubuntu is the ability to install
  directly off of the Live CD.&nbsp; This removes the need to
  download sperate CDs, simply download the live cd and show off
  how great Kubuntu is to your friends or give it a test run for
  the first time.&nbsp; Kubuntu's Live Installer program is called
  Ubiquity.</p>

  <p>Upon choosing to install Kubuntu, Ubiquity will start guiding
  you through the installation phase (see figure 7-4.</p>

  <img src="install2.png" />

  <p>Welcome Screen of Ubiquity</p>

  <p>&nbsp; Ubiquity will answer basic questions about what
  language you would like to install (figure 7-5) and then help
  guide you in setting up the correct country and time zone (figure
  7-6)</p>

<img src="install2.png" />
  <p>Choosing your Language</p>

      <img src="install3.png" />

  <p>Selecting the correct timezone</p>

  <p>One these have been, Ubiquity will prompt you to select the
  correct keyboard layout (figure 7-7) and help you create a user
  and that password, along with helping you assign a name for the
  install computer (figure 7-8)</p>
<img src="install4.png" />

  <p>Selecting Keyboard Layout</p>
<img src="install5.png" />

  <p>Configuring Computer Name and Username</p>

  <p>After filling out this information, Ubiquity will help you
  setup your disks and partition your disks, see figure 7-9.&nbsp;
  After everything is setup, Kubuntu will be installed and after
  everything is finished you will be prompted for a reboot (see
  figure&nbsp; 7-10).&nbsp; You are now ready to use your Kubuntu
  system.</p>
<img src="install7.png" />

  <p>Configuring Disk Partitions</p>
<img src="install10.png" />

  <p>Finishing Installing</p>

  <h3>Using Sudo</h3>

  <p>A large change, and one that many people stumble with before
  getting used to it, is the &ldquo;lack&rdquo; of a root account.
  Upon installation you are not prompted to provide with a root
  password. The password created with the first user is the
  password that will allow you to access the administrative
  functions. There will be many times when configuring the system
  or making global changes which will require the sudo password to
  complete.</p>

  <h2>Customizing Kubuntu</h2>

  <p>A major feature of Kubuntu is the amount of customization that
  can be done. Due to the freedom of Open Source software, if there
  is an application you are looking to use, you can find it.
  Everything from the desktop background to the font size of
  applications to the order and arrangement of the K menu can be
  customized.</p>

  <h3>Customizing the Desktop</h3>

  <p>By simply right-clicking on the desktop and selecting
  Configure Desktop a great deal of changes can be made. Kdesktop,
  as the application is called, is divided into five different
  sections: background, behavior, multiple desktops, screen saver,
  and display. As you can see from looking at Figure 7-11, the
  system looks a lot like the program used by Microsoft Windows to
  adjust the same properties.</p>

<img src="7-9configuredesktop.png" />

  <p>Kdesktop</p>

  <p>Kubuntu comes with several backgrounds that are installed by
  default. Any of these may be selected from the list. Additional
  backgrounds can be selected from KDE.org by clicking on Get New
  Wallpapers. Since Kubuntu is a multidesktop system, each desktop
  can have the same background, a different one, or even be sized
  differently. This system offers many opportunities for great
  customization.</p>

  <p>The behavior section allows the user to customize how the
  desktop behaves. Want icons on the desktop? Want a menu bar at
  the top of the screen? How does the mouse behave? Along with
  these options the user can choose what types of icons are used
  for each application and association.</p>

  <p>Interested in using multiple desktops? How about 20 of them?
  Any user can organize desktops based on tasks, thus grouping
  applications together based on the current task one is working.
  For example, this feature was applied specifically when this book
  was written. Day-to-day applications were open on one desktop
  while a word processing application, help applications, and a Web
  browser were all open on another desktop.</p>

  <p>Another important item that can be changed is the screen saver
  and how it operates. This section, which is under Configure
  Desktop, allows the user to select any of the preinstalled
  options or those downloaded from the Internet. After the correct
  screen saver has been chosen, simply configure it to start
  automatically and decide if it will lock your screen as well.</p>

  <p>The display section can help the user choose different screen
  sizes and refresh rates. In this section, one can also work with
  the power settings for your monitor, a great tool for laptop
  users. Power control allows the monitor to be suspended or
  powered off after a designated time period passes. These settings
  can also be applied upon startup if desired.</p>

  <p>Choosing how the desktop looks can help make Kubuntu feel
  personalized. If the appearance seems to be lacking, further
  changes can be made by choosing System Settings &gt; Appearance.
  This allows the user to further customize things such as colors,
  icons and style. Kubuntu is all about customization, and there
  are many ways to change how the desktop appears. This almost
  guarantees that no two users will have identical desktops.</p>

  <h3>Get Hot New Stuff</h3>

  <p>Looking for the latest screen saver, desktop background, or
  other cool things for your Kubuntu installation? Kubuntu fully
  supports the Get Hot New Stuff (GHNS) framework of KDE. GHNS
  allows people to upload templates to a server and have other
  users download and use that template. In an interview posted on
  KDE.news (http://dot.kde.org/1110652641) Josef Spillner describes
  exactly how the process works.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;[U]ser A is using a spreadsheet application and
  modifies a template that comes with it. This template can then be
  uploaded to a server and eventually be downloaded by user B by
  checking the contents of the &ldquo;Get Hot New Stuff&rdquo;
  download dialogue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The GHNS framework shows up several places throughout
  Kubuntu.</p>

  <p>One place where you can see this is when configuring the
  background for your desktop. On the right in this section is Get
  New Wallpapers. Upon selecting this, a new window will open up
  and display new wallpapers that you can use. These images come
  from www.kde-look.org.</p>

  <p>The GHNS framework at work</p>

  <p>Different applications have the capability to download
  information from the Internet and from KDE sites. Throughout
  applications in Kubuntu you will find references to &ldquo;Get
  More.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>Customizing Applets and the Kicker</h3>

  <p>The Kicker is the application launcher of KDE. The Kicker is
  also capable of running different docked applets such as the
  page, the task bar, or the clock. Applets are small applications
  that run inside the Kicker. The applet everyone is probably most
  familiar with is the task bar. It resides by default at the
  bottom of the screen and includes the K menu and programs that
  are currently up and running. The next applet over is also called
  the mini-pager. It shows a small preview of the different
  desktops and applications that are running in these desktops.
  Another applet that will be used on a regular basis is the Quick
  Launcher Applet. This allows the user to quickly start his or her
  favorite or most used programs.</p>

  <p>Everything that is part of the Kicker can be customized to
  meet the user&rsquo;s needs. It may even be removed. To add new
  items to the Quick Launcher Applet, simply right-click on this
  applet, and add the application to the panel. Find the program in
  the list or drag a shortcut from the desktop and access it at any
  time.</p>

  <h3>Customizing the K menu</h3>

  <p>The K menu makes adding, changing, and removing applications
  very easy to do. Upon installation, each application is placed in
  a certain location, but this may be altered. Simply right-click
  on the K menu, and select Menu Editor as shown in Figure
  7-13.</p>
<img src="7-11kmenueditor.png" />

  <p>Select menu editor</p>

  <p>In fact, the user can even change the location of the K menu
  or remove it altogether.</p>

  <p>Upon selecting the menu editor a new window will open up that
  will allow the user to make the desired changes. One of the most
  noticeable aspects of this application is that there are more
  folders in this list than in the K menu. This is due to a
  decision the team made to only show folders that have programs
  installed in them. To customize the K menu, simply use the tools
  provided under the File menu</p>

  <p>A major benefit of Kubuntu is that if the user does not like
  the way the system looks, he or she may change it. Almost
  everything can be customized to truly personalize the system.</p>

  <h2>Systems Administration</h2>

  <p>As with any computer application, Kubuntu will occasionally
  need administrative support. Do not be afraid of personally
  administrating the Kubuntu system. While it is not completely
  foolproof, there have been a lot of changes to help make things
  easier. Knowledge of the command line will go a long way in
  configuring the system, but the developers have made sure to
  provide graphical interfaces when they make sense. Everything
  from changing the IP address from Dynamic Host Control Protocol
  (DHCP) to static to installing packages can all be done without
  having to drop down to the command line. This section will focus
  exclusively on system administration through the graphical
  interface.</p>

  <h3>Installing New Packages</h3>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, Kubuntu is built around some of the same
  applications and system as Ubuntu. All applications are
  installable through packages. Like Ubuntu, Kubuntu uses the
  Advanced Package Tool (APT) and also like Ubuntu has a wonderful
  graphical interface that makes it easier to use that is called
  Adept. Adept is becoming the de facto installer for the KDE
  environment on Debian-based systems. This program was sponsored
  by Canonical Ltd. to help further the project of Kubuntu and
  other Linux distributions. The old package manager, Kynaptic, was
  lacking many features and was not user-friendly. Adept seeks to
  solve this problem.</p>

  <p>Adept is composed of four parts: the installer (Add/Remove
  Programs), the main program (Adept), adept update-notifier, and
  adpet-updater. These programs will help you install packages and
  keep your system up-to-date with the latest and greatest
  changes.</p>

  <p>To start Adept and begin installing new applications open up
  the K menu, and click on Add/Remove Programs, or simply type
  Add/Remove programs in Katapult. Once launched, the following
  screen (Figure 7-14) will be displayed.</p>

  <p>Figure 7-14</p>

  <p>Add/Remove Programs main window</p>

  <p>Add/Remove programs breaks programs into three groups:
  packages that can be installed with KDE, applications that can be
  installed with GNOME, and applications that can be installed on
  either desktop environment. Searching for that needed application
  is very simple. Just type in the application you are looking for,
  click on it, and select install.</p>

  <p>Installing an application with Add/Remove Programs</p>

  <p>Once you click on Apply Changes, Add/Remove Programs will
  download the information from the repository and install the
  application. Easy and painless. Add/Remove programs will also
  download any dependencies to prevent any conflicts or broken
  programs.</p>

  <p>The main Adept program is slightly more powerful than
  Add/Remove Programs. Not only can you can install programs and
  update your system, you can also manage the different
  repositories from which you can download programs.</p>

  <p>To start Adept and begin to install new applications open up
  the K menu, and move through the System folder to Adept.</p>

  <p>Adept</p>

  <p>Adept has an easy-to-use search feature that allows the user
  to quickly locate the application that needs to be installed.
  Simply locate the name of the application, click the drop down
  arrow, and select install. This will queue the package to be
  installed; simply clicking on apply changes will set up the
  application on the system. Unlike Microsoft Windows, Kubuntu is
  great about not forcing a system restart in order for the new
  application to work correctly.</p>

  <p>Note</p>

  <p>A restart could be required if the version of KDE is
  updated.</p>

  <p>Packages are organized into four different groups or
  repositories: main, restricted, universe, and multiverse. A
  standard installation will set up the system to install packages
  from the main repository. This repository contains applications
  that are free software, programs that allow for</p>

  <p>complete redistribution and which are also fully supported by
  the Kubuntu team. When the user installs something from the main
  repository he or she is guaranteed to receive security updates
  and support through the various venues.</p>

  <p>The restricted group of software is reserved for software that
  is commonly used and is supported by the Kubuntu team, even
  though they may not be able to change or update it. An example of
  software included here are binary videos drivers that some
  vendors publish.</p>

  <p>Software in the universe repository is where almost every
  other known Open Source software application can be found.
  Software here comes with a variety of licenses, and some might
  have restricted use in various countries. Users should take care
  to ensure that they do not violate these restrictions. Items
  built and maintained in this group are put together by the
  Masters of the Universe (MOTU). However, there is no support from
  the core developers for these items.</p>

  <p>Anything from the multiverse repository contains software that
  is not free, which is defined by the Kubuntu Main Component
  License Policy. Software here is used at the user&rsquo;s own
  risk.</p>

  <h3>Managing Repositories</h3>

  <p>With Adept, you do not need to know how to manually edit a
  sources.list. Adept can guide you through making these changes.
  From the File menu simply select Manage Repositories.</p>

  <p>Editing your repositories in Adept</p>

  <p>To enable the universe repository, edit the repository labeled
  universe, and remove the comments by following these steps.</p>

  <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Double-click on the comment next to
  ##http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu, and change the comment
  field to &ldquo;deb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Double-click on the actual address and
  remove the ## which acts to comment out the repository.</p>

  <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click on Apply at the bottom to save your
  changes.</p>

  <p>Repositories with universe enabled</p>

  <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Close this window by clicking Close.</p>

  <p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reload your sources by clicking Fetch
  Updates.</p>

  <p>Sometimes there is the need to add repositories to your
  sources listing, and that is done just as easily as enabling a
  repository.</p>

  <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Open up Manage Repositories from the File
  Menu.</p>

  <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Add the necessary Repository.</p>

  <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click on Apply and then Close to save
  your changes.</p>

  <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reload your sources for the new
  repository by clicking on Fetch Updates.</p>

  <h3>Installing a Package</h3>

  <p>The easiest way to find the package you need to install on
  your system is to use the search function built into Adept. After
  opening up Adept and typing in the password, you will be
  presented with the main Adept screen. Just type the name of the
  package you are looking for, and Adept will display a listing of
  every package that includes what you are looking for.</p>

  <p>Using the search bar in Adept to find packages</p>

  <p>Through the use of filters, Adept will help limit the package
  listing you are searching for. These filters include: show
  packages that are not installed, show packages that are
  installed, and show packages that are upgradeable.</p>

  <p>Once the package has been found, click on the name or drop
  down arrow, and Adept will display the description of the program
  and current version.</p>

  <p>Expanded information regarding a specific package</p>

  <p>At this time you will be presented with two options: install
  the package and view the details of the package. Details will
  show more information including dependent packages and where the
  files will be installed.</p>

  <p>Once an application is marked for installation, Adept will
  also mark all of the dependent files for installation as well.
  This will prevent what is referred to as &ldquo;dependency
  hell&rdquo; in which not all of the required files are installed
  to get an application to function correctly. Notice that the
  requested action will change from &ldquo;no change&rdquo; to
  &ldquo;install.&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>A very important part of installation packages through Adept
  is to make sure you always preview the changes by clicking on
  Preview Changes at the top before clicking Apply Changes. Any
  changes marked can be undone up to the point of applying them
  simply by clicking Undo.</p>

  <h3>Upgrading Kubuntu</h3>

  <p>If you are using the last release of Kubuntu, Kubuntu 5.10
  (the Breezy Badger), by simply editing the repositories you can
  upgrade to the most current version. To change from Breezy Badger
  to Dapper Drake, change all references to Dapper under Manage
  Repositories, and save the changes. Make sure you reload the
  repositories to get all the updates by selecting Fetch Updates.
  After the information is downloaded select Full Upgrade. That is
  it. No need to purchase a new OS, no need to worry about how a
  new version will affect the budget. Simply upgrade to the latest
  and greatest Kubuntu. Now it is time to grab a cup of coffee, sit
  back, relax, and watch the system upgrade as it will take a while
  to download all the changed packages and install them on the
  system.</p>

  <h2>How to Keep the System Up-to-Date</h2>

  <p>Two parts of Adept, the Adept Updater and the
  Adept-Updater-Notifier, will help keep the system current with
  the latest fixes and updates. Open up the K menu, and under the
  System folder launch the System Updater Wizard (Adept Updater).
  After entering your password, the application will launch and
  will allow the user to install any needed updates for the system.
  Like any software package, there are updates. However, Adept
  updater will help keep you current with the latest and greatest.
  Just as when installing new packages, the system will rarely have
  to be restarted for these changes to take effect.</p>

  <p>The Adept-Update-Notifier will periodically check for updates
  and will then allow the user to launch Adept-Updater and install
  the fixes. The application functions much like the Windows Update
  icon in Windows systems.</p>

  <p>When there are updates available for your system a red
  triangle will appear in the taskbar. Clicking on it will launch
  Adept-Updater. After entering your password the necessary updates
  will be downloaded and the user will be prompted for
  installation.</p>

  <h2>System Settings</h2>

  <p>The System Settings application (see Figure 7-23) is a new
  addition to Kubuntu. This program allows users to make many
  changes to the system, including setting Sound, User Accounts,
  Mouse Behavior, and other settings on the network. For those
  familiar with using KDE, System Settings replaces the K Control
  Center. However, the application is still there and can be run by
  hitting Alt+F2 for the run command and typing in Kcontrol or by
  typing Kcontrol in Katapult.</p>
<img src="7-20systemsettings.png" />

  <p>The System Settings application</p>

  <p>System Settings can be found in the K menu or by typing System
  Settings in Katapult.</p>

  <p>When making changes, there will be times that you will be
  prompted to enter your password. These changes are system-wide
  and will affect all users of the Kubuntu system and can be made
  by entering Administration Mode. System Settings is divided into
  four sections: personal, hardware, Internet and network, and
  system administration. When migrating through the different
  options, to return to the main screen, be sure to select Show All
  instead of closing out the application. This is a common mistake
  and may take some getting used to. Selecting this option will
  return the user to the main System Settings window.</p>

  <h4>Personal</h4>

  <p>Changes made to this section will only affect the current user
  signed in. The user can change the fonts, how the panel behaves,
  and various KDE components.</p>

  <p>Under the personal section, you can change the panel, desktop
  and even user information. Changing the desktop background and
  settings has already been addressed in this chapter. However,
  this is another way of accessing this information.</p>

  <p>One area in the personal settings where a lot of changes can
  be made to customize your Kubuntu system, including changing your
  password, is the user account section. Another area is session
  management. It can help save your settings upon logging out. You
  can do a lot of customization to make Kubuntu your very own.</p>

  <h4>Hardware</h4>

  <p>This section explains changing how the mouse functions, how
  power control is set up, and other hardware-related tasks. It is
  through this section that the user will learn to set up the type
  of printer connected to the Kubuntu system. Upon selecting
  Printers, the Common UNIX Print System (CUPS) will initialize and
  enable control of the printing subsystem. Figure 7-24 shows the
  printer window open.</p>
<img src="7-21printers.png" />

  <p>The printer window</p>

  <p>To add a printer select Add, and follow the guide for
  configuring the printer. CUPS can print to a locally attached
  printer, a network attached printer, or ever a printer shared out
  through a Windows print server. For some of the changes made at
  this level, the user will need to enter administration mode
  through use of your password.</p>

  <p>New to this version of Kubuntu (6.06) is the capability to
  change how the graphical system displays. Kubuntu provides an
  easy-to-use graphical tool (Display) to help manage the X window
  configuration. Now it is no longer a painful process to change
  your screen size or resolution, but can be easily done through
  the system settings window.</p>

  <h4>Internet and Network</h4>

  <p>In this section of System Settings, the user can make changes
  that affect how the system operates on a network. For those who
  use a wireless network, there is a good chance that the network
  card will be detected during installation. This can be managed
  here as well.</p>

  <p>New to this release of Kubuntu is the capability to run
  Zeroconf Discovery. Zeroconf allows computers to communicate on a
  network without any kind of configuration. This utility will
  discover the different services that are running on any computer
  that is available on any of the network connections. For example,
  Zeroconf comes into play when multiple users want to connect two
  laptops to each other via a cross-over cable to transfer a file
  or play a network game.</p>

  <p>Kubuntu can also be set up to share files and sessions across
  the network. By selecting Sharing, a new window will open up
  allowing the user to manage desktop sharing, file sharing, and
  even local network browsing. If desktop sharing is enabled,
  others can connect to the first user&rsquo;s Kubuntu and see what
  is happening on that desktop. This is a great utility for those
  trying to support and troubleshoot other computers. File sharing
  and local network browsing enable the system to act as mini-file
  server and provide outside access to files on the system.</p>

  <p>A lot of information can be modified under the Network
  section, but be careful. Users can drastically change how the
  system functions and may accidentally make a change that will
  prevent Internet access. See Figure 7-25 for an example of how
  this looks.</p>
<img src="7-22network.png" />

  <p>The network section</p>

  <p>When installing Kubuntu, the installer asked some questions
  that set up basic networking, including&nbsp; whether or not the
  IP address would be static or dynamic, the default gateway, and
  other necessary information. All of these options can be changed
  here. Any changes made to this section require your user
  password. In this section the user can make changes to the
  network interfaces, the routes, how Domain Name System
  (DNS)&nbsp; is set up, and create additional network profiles
  (See Figure 7-26). Making all these changes used to require
  knowledge of the command line, but now it can all be managed
  within Kubuntu.</p>
<img src="7-23changingdns.png" />

  <p>Configuring a network interface</p>

  <p>The first tab on the network settings window allows
  configuration of the different interfaces and determining if the
  addressing will be static or dynamic. Going left to right, the
  next tab allows changes to the default route and which interface
  to use. Instead of having to manually edit a host file, under the
  DNS tab you can set up different static host names and entries.
  This is all information that you set up during installation, but
  it can later be changed here.</p>

  <p>Setting up and changing how your system works used to require
  knowledge of text files and the command line, scaring people away
  from using Linux. With the advent of different graphical tools
  and the intuitive grouping of programs, system administration has
  become a lot easier.</p>

  <h3>System Administration</h3>

  <p>The final section of System Settings deals administrating your
  Kubuntu system. Changes made here will require that you enter
  your password. Items that can be changed in this section include
  date and time, users and groups, regional settings, services, and
  other options.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the users and groups section you can manage
  who will be able to access the system and what groups they belong
  to. If you would like more then one person to be able to access
  the sudo account, add that individual to the admin group.
  However, you will need access to the sudo password to make any
  changes here.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The process of adding and changing users has been
  simplified to help you out..</p>

  <p>Adding users through system settings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is your
  newly installed Web server not starting automatically? Are you
  having problems setting up a service to run correctly? System
  services will guide you through the different run levels and
  setting up when a service will start. Figure 7-28 shows an
  example of making such a change.</p>
<img src="7-25services.png" />

  <p>Configuring services</p>

  <h2>Managing Files with Kubuntu</h2>

  <p>Now that you have your system installed and set up the way you
  would like, it is time to understand how to navigate the
  different files and ways to access information in Kubuntu. That
  starts with the default file manager Konqueror.</p>

  <h3>Introduction to Konqueror</h3>

  <p>Konqueror is a very powerful file manager that can do more
  then just browsing of your directories, it is also the second Web
  browser to pass the ACID2 test. As a file manager, Konquerer can
  do everything a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; file manager can (See Figure
  7-29). Files can be browsed through either an &ldquo;icon
  view&rdquo; or a &ldquo;tree view.&rdquo; Copying, pasting,
  moving, and deleting files are all simple tasks that can be done
  through Konqueror. A nice feature of Konqueror is that
  directories automatically update. This means that if a file is
  created in a directory currently being viewed it is not necessary
  to refresh the directory to see the changes.</p>
<img src="7-26konqueror.png" />
  
  <p>Figure 7-29</p>

  <p>Konqueror</p>

  <p>One of the great things about Konqueror is how much you can do
  within it. Need access to media files? Simply type media:/ and
  browse your media files. All other kinds of shortcuts, called
  kioslave, exist in Konqueror, including searching the Web with
  Google (gg: KEYWORD), or even browsing files via ssh through
  sftp://. Need help finding a file on your system? Simply use
  locate:/ to have Konqueror find it for you. You can visit the
  different system folders through system:/. There are all kinds of
  shortcuts and keywords like this built into Konqueror, including
  Google suggest in the search bar.</p>

  <p>Another feature of Kubuntu is a built-in universal viewer.
  Click on a file, and it will show the file contents. This works
  for images, postscript files, and many other file types. Any new
  type of file just needs to register to work in this way.</p>

  <h3>Finding Files and Folders</h3>

  <p>Konqueror&rsquo;s built-in search capability allows you to
  find that file or folder you are looking for. One of the
  kioslaves is locate:, which will help you search for files. In
  the address type locate: followed by the file or folder name and
  hit enter. Konqueror will then find what you are looking for. See
  Figure 7-30for an example of locate: in action</p>
<img src="7-27locate.png" />

  <p>Using locate: to find files in Konqueror</p>

  <p>The search bar, which is located next to the address can also
  help you find files and folders. This toolbar functions exactly
  like a search bar in a Web browser. Simply type the name of the
  file or folder you are looking for, hit enter and Konqueror will
  then go out and find the files or folders requested.</p>

  <h3>Ripping Audio CDs</h3>

  <p>While AmaroK (discussed later in the chapter) can help you
  manage your music collection, Konqueror can help you add (rip)
  CDs into your collection so you can listen to them on your iPod
  or mp3 device. Simply place the CD in the CD-ROM drive, and, when
  prompted, open it up in a new window. There will be different
  folders labeled with different media formats. For example, if you
  are using the Ogg Vorbis format (the default format for media
  files in Kubuntu), open the folder and copy them to the directory
  where you store your collection. Another application to use to
  rip music is KaudioCreator, which is discussed later in the
  chapter.</p>

  <h3>Accessing Windows Partitions</h3>

  <p>A lot of people still have Windows partitions on their hard
  drives and would like to access the information stored there.
  Kubuntu can browse these files in read-only mode. Each Windows
  partition needs to be mounted before it can be accessed in
  Konquerer. This is a very simple process.</p>

  <p>By default, Kubuntu mounts all its media in the /media
  directory, and your windows directory will be mounted in the same
  location. First, create a directory. Next, mount the partition to
  that directory. All of this work will be done from the command
  line, so open up Konsole, Kubuntu&rsquo;s terminal program (See
  Figure 7-31, and create the directory by typing sudo mkdir
  /media/windows. Enter your password. After the directory is
  created, mount the directory by typing the following sudo mount
  /devhda1 /media/windows -t ntfs -o nls=utf8,umask=0222. In
  simpler terms, this command will mount the directory in the
  correct folder with permissions that will allow you to access it
  in Konqueror. (Note: Read-only access is limited to NTFS
  partitions. Kubuntu can read and write to partitions formatted as
  FAT.)</p>
<img src="7-28konsolewithcommands.png" />

  <p>Konsole with commands</p>

  <p>Now you can browse files that are still stored on your Windows
  partition.</p>

  <h3>Accessing USB Drives</h3>

  <p>USB drives are everywhere these days, and Kubuntu handles them
  quite easily. Simply connect your USB drive, and it will auto
  mount. These drives will then be available under Konqueror
  through the media folder. Before removing the drive, make sure
  that you unmount it by right-clicking on the device and selecting
  Eject. The device can then be safely removed.</p>

  <h3>Managing Music</h3>

  <p>Kubuntu comes with a great program that can help manage all of
  your music files called amaroK (See Figure 7-32).</p>
<img src="7-29amarok.png" />

  <p>amaroK</p>

  <p>This application can serve as a full-fledged media library
  that can create play lists, track how often the user listens to a
  certain song, and even interact with your iPod. Looking for
  lyrics to the song that is currently playing? AmaroK can find
  them. Wondering what the CD cover of your favorite new album
  looks like? AmaroK can grab this information for the user as
  well. Along with media stored locally, amaroK can track podcasts
  and even let you listen to your favorite Internet radio station.
  Music is stored in a collection library that is arranged by
  artist, album, and song based on the tags built into the media.
  Each song can be rated, which can help determine the frequency of
  it appearing during &ldquo;shuffle mode.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Upon launching amaroK for the first time there is a nice
  wizard that helps configure the user&rsquo;s collection. This
  First-Run Wizard will set up how the program will be displayed
  and the location of the folders that music is stored in. (Yes, a
  collection can be built across many different folders and sub
  folders.)</p>

  <p>&nbsp;After setting these two options, amaroK will ask the
  user how the music will be stored. Since the application uses a
  database, this information can be stored in SQLIte, MySQL, or
  PostgreSQL depending on what is installed and your preferences.
  If at any time the user needs to make changes to how things are
  configured, the First-Run wizard can be rerun at anytime from the
  Tools menu. Figures 7-33 through 7-36 present several screenshots
  of the First-Run Wizard.</p>
<img src="7-30firsruninterface.png" />

  <p>Welcome to the First-Run Wizard</p>
<img src="7-31firstlook.png" />

  <p>Choosing the default look of amaroK</p>
<img src="7-32collection.png" />

  <p>Selecting the location your catalog</p>
<img src="7-33database.png" />

  <p>Choosing the type of database to store your collection in</p>

  <p>In order to listen to .mp3 files, an additional package will
  need to be installed from multiverse (see the section on Managing
  Repositories) through Adept. The package, libxine-extraodecs will
  also enable you to play some VI and some QuickTime videos,
  (S)VCDs, and most video files out there.</p>

  <p>Now that your collection is configured, it time to create your
  play lists Simply select the songs you would like to listen to,
  and drag them over to the play list pane. If you would like to
  listen to all of your music, select dynamic mode, and it will
  create a play list based on past listening habits. The more you
  listen to a certain song the greater chance that song will repeat
  or a similar song will appear in the dynamic play list.</p>

  <h2>Common Applications</h2>

  <p>Kubuntu comes with a large number of applications preinstalled
  and configured, including Web browsers, office applications, and
  e-mail. Remember, since choice is a huge factor in Kubuntu, if
  you do not like the default applications you can always change
  them. All of these applications are available through the K
  menu.</p>

  <h3>OpenOffice.org</h3>

  <p>The default office application for Kubuntu is OpenOffice.org
  2.0. This version is the second major release of the suite that
  includes Writer, Calc, Draw, Impress, and Math. Each of these
  programs is easy-to-use and can help you switch from the
  Microsoft Office product line. In fact, the OpenOffice.org suite
  that can be installed on a Windows system comes on the
  installation CD to help you get comfortable and ready for a
  switch to Kubuntu. Each application corresponds to a similar
  application in the MS Product line. Calc is very similar to
  Excel, Writer is the same for Word, Impress is PowerPoint, and
  Base functions similarly to Access. OpenOffice.org can handle all
  but Microsoft Access files without problems, and the whole suite
  is ready to be used in a corporate environment as well as for
  personal use.</p>

  <p>To demonstrate the power of OpenOffice.org, we will work on
  creating a new document. To open up OpenOffice.org Writer, open
  up the K menu, navigate to Office, and then OpenOffice.org
  Writer. You can also launch Katapult, type in Writer, and hit
  Enter.</p>

  <p>Writer resembles any other word processing software you have
  used before. Simply start typing your letter or paper as you
  normally would, and use the toolbar for formatting options that
  you require, including changing alignment, bold-facing,
  italicizing, and other needs.</p>

  <p>When you are done working on a document, save the document
  through File &gt; Save or by typing Ctrl+S. OpenOffice.org saves
  documents in the Open Document format. This file format is a
  standard across the world. You can also save documents in other
  formats, including Microsoft Office and Adobe PDF format. To save
  as a PDF file, just click the PDF button on the main toolbar
  (located next to the print icon), and enter a filename.</p>

  <p>As mentioned before, Kubuntu CDs come with Open Source
  software that can be installed on Windows PCs so you can learn
  the OpenOffice.org suite before installing Kubuntu if you choose
  to do so.</p>

  <h3>Web Browsing</h3>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, Konqueror can function as a file manager
  as well as a Web browser. To launch Konqueror, open up the K
  menu, navigate to Internet, then Konqueror. Alternately, you can
  launch Katapult (Alt+Space) and type in Konqueror.&nbsp; Like
  other modern Web browsers, Konqueror provides tabbed browsing,
  the capability to have multiple Web pages open in the same
  window. To do this, go File &gt; New Tab or press Ctrl+T. A new
  tab will be created in your open Konqueror window. A cool feature
  is that you can be browsing the Web in one tab, browsing your
  home directory in another tab, and also browsing network folders
  in a third tab. All of these functions can help manage your
  taskbar and help keep your desktop looking clean and sharp.</p>

  <p>As a Web browser, Konqueror enables you to set bookmarks,
  change your Home Page, and utilize all the other features you
  would expect from a Web browser.</p>

  <p>Navigating around the Internet is no different in Konqueror
  than in any other Web browser, including Firefox, Opera,
  Netscape, or Internet Explorer. Just type the Web address into
  the address bar, and hit Enter. For example, type in
  www.kubuntu.com to visit the home page for Kubuntu.</p>

  <p>To search using Google, simply move to the search bar, and
  directly to the right of the address bar type in what you are
  looking for. Konqueror will use Google to find it for you.</p>

  <p>Using the Google search bar to search the Web</p>

  <p>Tip</p>

  <p>If you are using Konqueror in the file manager mode, the
  Google search bar defaults to locate, which will search your hard
  drive.</p>

  <p>Often when browsing the Web, you will see an orange icon at
  the bottom of Konqueror. This means there is an RSS (Really
  Simple Syndication) feed available. To track this feed, simply
  click on it, and Konqueror will add it to your subscribed feeds
  in Akregator. More information on Akregator will be provided
  later in this chapter.</p>

  <h3>Using Firefox for Browsing the Web</h3>

  <p>Allowing choice is a key feature of Ubuntu, and Kubuntu ships
  with the latest available version of Firefox (as of this writing
  1.5.1). Firefox has taken the Web browser world by storm and is
  as good or even better then Internet Explorer. Firefox not only
  provides better features and a better browsing experience, it
  adheres better to Web standards. Like Konqueror, Firefox includes
  tab browsing (File &gt; New Tab or Ctrl+T), bookmarks, and
  everything you would expect of a modern Web browser.</p>

  <p>Firefox has a lot of different extensions that can be plugged
  in and allows greater flexibility for your Web browser. The most
  common plug-ins are for using Macromedia Flash and Java, things
  some Web pages require.</p>

  <p>Installing a plug-in is as simple as visiting a Web site that
  requires it. A yellow bar will appear indicating you are missing
  a plug-in. Click on the Install Missing Plug-ins button to
  install the required plug-in.</p>

  <h3>Burning CDs&mdash;Audio and Data</h3>

  <p>Another common task is creating or burning CDs both for
  listening to music or for creating a backup of your system.
  Kubuntu&rsquo;s default CD creation program is K3b. K3b provides
  a very familiar (See Figure 7-38) interface for burning and
  copying CDs.</p>
<img src="7-34k3b.png" />

  <p>K3b</p>

  <p>Simply click on one of icons from the main Kreator screen that
  describes the project you would like to create: a new audio CD, a
  new Data CD, a new data DVD project, or even copy a CD. After the
  new project has been started, simply drag the files from the top
  section to the lower section (See Figure 7-39).</p>
<img src="7-35k3bdata.png" />

  <p>Just drag and drop the files</p>

  <p>Once the files have been selected, select Burn, and sit back
  while your new CD is created. K3b is a very easy-to-use utility
  that can help with the creation of backup CDs or even new music
  CDs.</p>

  <h3>KaudioCreator</h3>

  <p>KaudioCreator can be launched through the Multimedia section
  in the K menu or through Katapault by typing KaudioCreator. To
  rip music, you first need to configure the correct encoder.
  Simply use the wizard under Settings &gt; Configure KaudioCreator
  to select the correct encoder, OggEnc or FLAC. To create mp3s out
  of files you will need to use Adept to install Lame from the
  universe repository. Upon selecting the encoder, the files will
  be placed automatically in /home/username/encoder. See Figure
  7-340 for an example of Configure KaudioCreator.</p>
<img src="7-36kaudiocreator.png" />

  <p>KAudioCreator in action</p>

  <p>KaudioCreator will automatically try to connect to CDDB to
  download the artist and track information. This will help you to
  better manage your music collection.</p>

  <p>Once the track information has been downloaded from CDDB
  (Compact Disk Database0, simply click on the tracks you would
  like to rip, or click on Select All Tracks. Once the tracks have
  been selected, click on Rip Selection directly under the Settings
  menu, or go to File &gt; Rip Selection.</p>

  <p>KaudioCreator will help you convert the music from your CDs
  into a format that you can use with your iPod or other mp3
  player.</p>

  <h3>Instant Messaging</h3>

  <p>Instant Messaging is another application that we almost cannot
  live without these days. Kopete, Kubuntu&rsquo;s default instant
  messaging client, handles this task very well. It is found under
  the Internet section in the K menu. You can also launch Kopete
  from Katapult by typing Kopete. The beauty of Kopete is that it
  can connect to all of the major service providers, so you do not
  have to have multiple programs open. Kopete can handle ICQ, MSN
  Messenger, Yahoo Messagner, and AIM. The newest version of
  Kopete, which is included with Kubuntu, can handle MSN Webcams as
  well. Because Gtalk (Google&rsquo;s Instant Message program) is
  built around the Jabber protocol, Kopete can handle that as well.
  Figure 7-41 shows a sample of Kopete in action.</p>
<img src="7-37kopete.png" />

  <p>Kopete</p>

  <p>The first time Kopete is launched the Configure Kopete wizard
  opens. First, set up the different accounts that you will use to
  connect. Kopete can save your passwords to these accounts and
  even automatically connect upon startup.</p>

  <p>Once the accounts are configured correctly, you can change
  Kopete&rsquo;s behavior to fit your preferences. There are many
  options that can be selected, including away settings, what
  happens when a new message arrives, and even how the system
  starts up.</p>

  <p>As mentioned previously, new in the latest version of Kopete
  is the capability to access MSN Webcam chats. Configuring how
  Kopete deals with Webcams is the last option that can be changed
  here.</p>

  <h3>Kontact</h3>

  <p>These days almost everyone uses e-mail, and almost everyone
  uses some form of calendar program to keep track of appointments
  and schedules. Kontact, Kubuntu&rsquo;s default PIM (Personal
  Information Manager), will take care of all of these tasks plus
  more. Open up Kontact, and it will look like Figure 7-41.</p>
<img src="7-38kontact.png" />

  <p>Kontact</p>

  <p>From looking at the example, you can see that Kontact has a
  lot of different features, and we cover a lot of the
  program&rsquo;s options in the following sections. To start
  Kontact, go to K menu &gt; Internet section. You can also start
  it from Katapult by typing Kontact.</p>

  <p>Kmail is the program that handles e-mail. It can be run
  separately from Kontact if you choose. The first step in
  configuring Kontact is to set up Kmail to send and receive
  e-mail.</p>

  <p>Setting Up Your E-mail Account</p>

  <p>There are several pieces of information that you will need to
  know in order to set up things. Your Internet Service Provider
  (ISP) or system administrator should be able to provide these
  details to you. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Type of e-mail server (such as POP or
  IMAP)</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mail server name (such as
  mail.domainname.com)</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mail account&rsquo;s username and
  password</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Authentication type (typically
  'password')</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Outgoing mail server name</p>

  <p>When Kontact is launched for the first time, a wizard will
  start that will guide you through setting up this information.
  The first option will be to set up your identify with the e-mail
  address in the E-mail Address box and add any optional
  information that you would like. Click Forward to continue.</p>

  <p>When you choose the type of e-mail server you are using, the
  options will vary. Fill in the server name and the username. The
  Security and Authentication Type settings may need to be changed,
  but for most accounts the default settings should be fine. Click
  Forward to continue.</p>

  <p>The next screen does not have to be filled out, but decide
  what you want to do based on your preferences. However, the next
  screen will help you set up sending e-mail. Select the server
  type, typically SMTP, and add the server name to the server box.
  Click Forward to continue. Finally click on Finish to close the
  wizard and begin using Kmail.</p>

  <p>Using Korganize</p>

  <p>Korganize is included with Kontact. It will track your
  schedule and provide reminders of your appointments. Upon
  switching Kontact to calendar mode, you will see a month view on
  the right and actual dates on the right, as Figure 7-343
  shows.</p>
<img src="7-39calendar.png" />

  <p>Korganize, Kontact&rsquo;s in calendar mode</p>

  <p>There are two different types of events that can be set up in
  Kontact:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Meetings: Events scheduled with different
  people</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Appointments: General events</p>

  <p>It is easy to add a new appointment. Find the date for the
  event in the month view, right-click, and select New Event. In
  the new window that opens up, fill out the Summary, Location,
  Time and Description boxes. You can also set up Kontact to remind
  you when it is time for the appointment.</p>

  <p>Another great application that is a part of Kontact (or which
  can be used separately) is Akregator, an RSS (Really Simple
  Syndication) program that can track your favorite Web feeds. Due
  to the integration of Akregator and Konqueror, any Web page that
  has an RSS feed will have an orange icon in the corner of the
  program.</p>

  <p>Using the RSS icon to add a feed to Akregator Simply click on
  the icon and select Add to Akregator. Akregator will keep your
  feeds up-to-date by automatically checking for new content.
  Another bonus of the integration between Konqueror and Akregator
  is that Web pages can be opened up within Akgreator to post
  comments and view more information than what is provided by the
  Web feed.</p>

  <p>Kontact is a great program that can help organize your life,
  track your favorite Web sites thru RSS and be your e-mail
  application.</p>

  <h3>Krita</h3>

  <p>Kubuntu comes with a great program to help edit and create
  photos or drawings. Krita, which can be found under the Graphics
  section of the K menu or launched from Katapult by typing Krita,
  is a fully functional graphics program. Everything including
  photo retouching, image editing and creating original art can be
  done with Krita. Krita can handle almost any type of image file
  format including Photoshop files created with version 6</p>

  <h4>Creating a New Image</h4>

  <p>Upon starting Krita, you will be prompted to either start a
  new image or open up an existing one. Under Create Document,
  there is a group of templates that can be used to create this
  image, ordered by color model. As we will be creating a new
  image, just use the Empty Document, and you will be prompted with
  the New Image dialog box (Figure 7-45).</p>
<img src="7-40newimage.png" />

  <p>Custom document in Krita</p>

  <p>At this point you can name your document, specify the width,
  Height,&nbsp; and resolution, and set the color mode and depth of
  your image.</p>

  <p>The main screen for Krita is displayed, which can be somewhat
  confusing. There are toolbars on the left, right and top of the
  window, and the actual painting area is in the middle (Figure
  7-46).</p>
<img src="7-41kritamain.png" />

  <p>The main window for Krita</p>

  <h4>Manipulating an Existing Document</h4>

  <p>Another example of using Krita is cropping an existing
  document to a new size. This is easily done using the different
  tools. Open up an existing image, and use the Select a
  rectangular area tool located on the left in the Krita
  toolbar.</p>

  <p>After selecting the area you would like, Krita makes the
  outside area grey. Figure 7-47 shows what this looks like.</p>
<img src="7-42selectingareainkrita.png" />

  <p>Selecting an area in Krita</p>

  <p>Once the portion of the image you would like has been
  selected, hit Ctrl-Xto cut the image. A cool feature of Krita is
  that you can then paste what you cut into a new image by
  selecting Paste into New Image from the Edit menu (Figure
  7-48).</p>
<img src="7-43newimage.png" />

  <p>Paste into a new image in Krita</p>

  <p>Krita is a great image manipulation tool that can help you
  with all of your image needs. For more information on how to use
  Krita, refer to the Krita handbook included with Kubuntu as
  discussed later in the chapter.</p>

  <h3>Watching Movies and Playing CDs</h3>

  <p>The default media player for movies and also for listening to
  CDs is a great program called kaffiene. Kaffiene can be found
  under the K menu under Multimedia or launched from Katapult by
  typing Kaffiene. This program functions a lot like Windows Media
  Player for those coming from a Windows background.</p>

  <h3>Internet Relay Chat</h3>

  <p>A great place to find support for Kubuntu is Internet Relay
  Chat (IRC) is through Konversation and the different IRC
  channels. Join irc.freenode.org, and then come over to #Kubuntu
  to get any of your support questions answered. The people there
  are full of great knowledge and can probably solve any issue or
  problem that you have.</p>

  <p>Konverstation can be found in the Internet section under the K
  menu. Upon start up for the first time, a wizard will open and
  allow you to configure your identity, the account which you use
  to connect to the different channels. See Figure 7-49 for an
  example.</p>
<img src="7-45identies.png" />

  <p>Manage identities in Konversation</p>

  <p>Remember #Kubuntu is a great place to find help with your
  Kubuntu installation, so set up Konverstation to automatically
  connect to that channel upon startup.</p>

  <h3>Kiosk Mode</h3>

  <p>Kubuntu allows you to completely configure your desktop and
  one of the best examples of this is using Kubuntu in Kiosk mode.
  Kiosk mode allows an administrator to configure KDE and all
  aspects of the desktop and prevent the end user from changing the
  settings.</p>

  <p>KDE stores all of its configuration information in text files
  that are similar to Windows INI files. These files control
  everything from the default background to whether or not a person
  can add bookmarks. To see the locations of the configuration
  files, simply type kde-config &ndash;path config from the
  Konsole. Note that the order applied is the reverse order of what
  is displayed.</p>

  <p>By simply changing one of the files in the highest priority,
  last listed in kde-config, you can affect what all users see.</p>

  <p>To change the background for all users simply edit the
  Wallpaper section found in kdesktoprc located in
  /usr/share/kubuntu-default-zettings/kde-profile/default/share/config.
  See Figure 7-50 for an example of this.</p>
<img src="7-46editingwallpaper.png" />

  <p>Editing the Wallpaper section for Kiosk mode</p>

  <p>As previously discussed, each user can change their desktop to
  meet his or her own needs. However, an administrator can make it
  so some things cannot be changed. Simply insert [$i] at the top
  of the file for each application you would like to make
  immutable. Figure 7-51 shows the background changed and made
  immutable.</p>
<img src="7-47desktopimmutable.png" />

  <p>A default background made immutable</p>

  <p>Along with enabling or setting changes, an administrator can
  remove user access to certain items by simply editing the
  kdeglobals file and adding a [KDE Action Restrictions] [$i]
  section. Figure 7-52 shows the process of removing the capability
  to start a konsole.</p>

  <p>Removing access to starting a konsole session&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &nbsp;</p>

  <p>A great tool that can help with setting up Kiosk mode is
  iosktool</p>

  <p>There are plenty of additional items that can be limited and
  changed in Kubuntu.</p>

  <h3>Exploring the Kubuntu Landscape</h3>

  <p>Unlike many other OS, Kubuntu includes a large amount of
  applications right inside the system. These tools have been
  selected to allow you to install Kubuntu and then just get your
  work done. Some of the applications installed by default have
  been covered already. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on
  how you look at it), there are just too many applications to go
  over due to space restrictions.</p>

  <p>To partially solve that problem, here is a quick summary of
  many programs that are available from the K menu, including how
  to find them along with a brief description.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kate K menu &gt; Utilities &gt; Kate</p>

  <p>This simple and powerful text editor is great for editing
  documents, making quick notes, and programming. There is a vast
  range of plug-ins for items such as&nbsp; spellchecking,
  statistics, and syntax highlighting.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Calculator (Speedcrunch)</h4>

  <p>K menu &gt; Utilities &gt; Calculator</p>

  <p>Speedcrunch is an extremely powerful calculator that can help
  you solve both basic and advanced math problems.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;KonsoleK menu &gt; Utilities &gt;
  Konsole</p>

  <p>Beneath the desktop is a very powerful command line core.
  Konsole allows you access to this powerful command line by
  putting a nice window frame around it. Konsole is great for the
  command line junkies, those who prefer to do things with a
  graphical interface. Konsole can be completely customized to meet
  your command line needs.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Info Center (KinfoCenter)</h4>

  <p>K menu &gt; System &gt; Info Center</p>

  <p>The KinfoCenter provides information about your system,
  including partitions, network interfaces, and other important
  features about your system.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Performance Monitor (KsysGuard)</h4>

  <p>K menu &gt; System &gt; Performance Monitor</p>

  <p>The Performance Monitor provides information about how your
  Kubuntu system is functioning. Having problems with an
  application taking too much memory? How would you know? KsysGuard
  provides this information.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;System Logs Viewer (KsystemLog)K menu &gt;
  System &gt; System Logs Viewer</p>

  <p>Interested in what is going on with your system? Kubuntu keeps
  track of files and access logs that can be viewed through this
  program.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CD Player (KsCD)</h4>

  <p>K menu &gt; Multimedia &gt; CD Player</p>

  <p>KsCD is a great little program that will allow you to listen
  to CDs. KsCD will grab the track information from FreeDB and then
  display this information as the track is played.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Internet Dial-Up Tool (KPPP)</h4>

  <p>K menu &gt; Internet &gt; Internet Dial-Up Tool</p>

  <p>Need help connecting to you ISP (Internet Service Provider)
  through a modem? KPPP will help take care of this. KPPP can help
  setup your modem and even setup your dial up connection.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remote Desktop Connection (Krdc)</h4>

  <p>K menu &gt; Internet &gt; Remote Desktop Connection</p>

  <p>KRDC can help you connect to remote systems either through the
  remote desktop protocol (RDP) or through virtual network
  connection (VNC). Simply type in the address, and click on
  connect. The remote desktop connection can save the settings for
  each computer that you connect to.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bluetooth Chat and Bluetooth OBEX
  Client</h4>

  <p>K menu &gt; Internet &gt; Bluetooth Chat</p>

  <p>K menu &gt; Internet &gt; Bluetooth OBEX Client</p>

  <p>The applications are installed by default and are new to this
  release of Kubuntu. They both help you connect to various
  Bluetooth-enabled devices.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PDF Viewer (KPDF)</h4>

  <p>K menu &gt; Graphics &gt; PDF Viewer</p>

  <p>KPDF provides you with the ability to open and view files
  saved in the Adobe PDF format</p>

  <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Screen Capture Program (KsnapShot)</h4>

  <p>K menu &gt; Graphics &gt; Screen Capture Program</p>

  <p>KsnapShot is a great application that allows you to take
  screenshots and save them in different formats. The great thing
  about KsnapShot is that you specify the exact amount of the
  screen that will be captured. This program was used to take the
  screenshots for this chapter.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Image Viewer (Gwenview)</h4>

  <p>K menu &gt; Graphics &gt; Image Viewer</p>

  <p>Gwenview is the default application for viewing images in
  Kubuntu. All different types of images can be opened including
  .png, .jpeg, and .bmp.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kdevelop</h4>

  <p>While not installed by default, Kdevelop is a wonderful
  Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that can help out with
  your coding projects. Simply install it using Adept, and you will
  find it located under the Development menu in the K menu.</p>

  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

  <p>The more you use Kubuntu, the more you will learn some tips
  and tricks to help make your computing experience better and
  easier. Kubuntu can be configured to do almost anything you would
  like.</p>

  <h4>Run Programs Automatically When Kubuntu Starts</h4>

  <p>Sometimes there are programs you would like to start
  automatically every time you login to your system. An example of
  this is Katapult, which was discussed earlier in the chapter. It
  starts automatically and runs in the background. There are four
  easy steps to set this up using the session management feature of
  KDE. KDE can save everything and then restore those settings for
  you.</p>

  <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Open up System Settings from the K menu
  and click on the User Account Section.</p>

  <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click the Session Manager button on the
  left, and make sure that the Restore manually saved session
  checkbox is enabled.</p>

  <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Log out saving your sessions.</p>

  <h4>Login Automatically to Kubuntu When the Computer Starts</h4>

  <p>It is possible to set up Kubuntu so a user is logged in
  automatically when the computer boots. This change is not
  recommended for must computers as it is insecure and may allow
  others to access your information.</p>

  <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Open up the System Settings from the K
  menu.</p>

  <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click on Administrator Mode, and entering
  your password to gain administrator privileges.</p>

  <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Select the Convenience tab, and check
  Enable Autologin.</p>

  <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Select the user to autologin from the
  drop down menu, and select an appropriate time delay.</p>

  <h4>Automatically Turn on Num Lock When Kubuntu Starts</h4>

  <p>If you are sick of always having to turn on your numlock, the
  change is very simple to make.</p>

  <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Open up System Settings from the K menu,
  and select Keyboard.</p>

  <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Under the NumLock on KDE Startup, enable
  the Turn On checkbox.</p>

  <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click on Apply to save your settings.</p>

  <h2>Finding Help and Giving Back to the Community</h2>

  <p>KDE is the best documented desktop environment around, and
  Kubuntu strives to match that level. Kubuntu currently ships with
  three documents: the Release Notes, About Kubuntu, and the
  Desktop Guide, all of which feature specific Kubuntu material and
  are maintained by the Ubuntu Documentation Team.</p>

  <h3>Finding Help</h3>

  <p>Help is found through the Khelpcenter and is organized around
  applications and then tasks. Khelpcenter is launched either
  through the K menu under Help, or is available from the main
  screen or from the start page of Konquerer..</p>

  <p>The Khelpcenter</p>

  <h3>Accessing KDE Help Manuals</h3>

  <p>Along with the Kubuntu documents, Kubuntu ships with the help
  documents for all of the major applications that can also be
  accessed through the KhelpCenter. These manuals can help solve
  some of your common problems and answer many of your
  questions.</p>

  <p>The default home page for Konqueror lists the help documents
  that are shipped in Kubuntu. The list includes the following:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;About Kubuntu: This includes information
  regarding Kubuntu and the Kubuntu project.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Release Notes:</p>

  <p>Interested in what is installed by default in Kubuntu? This
  guide gives a quick overview of what is new and what is
  supported.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Desktop Guide:</p>

  <p>This document is brand new in Kubuntu 6.06 and will guide you
  through some of the basic needs for operating your Kubuntu
  system. A lot of information in this chapter can be found in that
  guide.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Packaging Guide:</p>

  <p>Would you like to learn how to package applications to give a
  hand to the Kubuntu project? This guide will show you what you
  need to create a package that will be accepted by the
  maintainers.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Server Guide:</p>

  <p>If you are interested in running Kubuntu as a server, this
  guide will help you get set up. Items that are included are
  running Kubuntu as a file server and/or a Web server. This is a
  great resource for more advanced users.</p>

  <p>If you still need help after looking in the documentation,
  Kubuntu provides other means for finding this information. A
  great place to start is on the IRC channel #Kubuntu, which, as we
  noted earlier, can be accessed through Konverstation. There are
  always wonderful and knowledgeable people in this channel who can
  answer almost any question. If you prefer to use the Web for
  answers, the Kubuntu wiki, found at www.wiki.kubuntu.org, has a
  large amount of information loosely organized with a great search
  function built in. A third place to find information is the
  Kubuntu forums at www.kubuntuforums.org. Remember Google is your
  friend as well. Chances are someone else has come across your
  problem before and has written a solution to the issue.</p>

  <h3>Giving Back to the Community</h3>

  <p>Kubuntu is built around a great community of people who give
  back what they learn. There are many ways to get involved and
  share your love of Kubuntu. A great place to find out how you can
  make a difference is at www.ubuntu.com/community/participate. Not
  everyone involved has to know how to create packages, understand
  how their kernel works, or be a great programmer. Kubuntu also
  has a place for people to write wiki pages or help out with
  documentation needs.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>Kubuntu is a great part of the Ubuntu project and is quickly
  maturing. From its start as the idea of a single developer to
  many people working together, Kubuntu is becoming the KDE
  distribution of choice. However, there is still room for
  improvement and additions to the setup. A large community of
  people discuss every day, either through IRC or e-mail, ways to
  make these improvements. Bugs and other issues are quickly
  resolved without the additional cost of new programs.</p>

  <p>Kubuntu is going to be around for the long haul, and each new
  release delivers a better, cleaner, and more polished OS. Help
  spread the word about the project, and get involved by helping
  out.</p>
