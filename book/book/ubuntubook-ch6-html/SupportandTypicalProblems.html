<br>

Despite the fact that the Ubuntu developers work tirelessly to make the
Ubuntu user experience as fluid and problem-free as possible, there are
always going to be bugs, glitches, and errors in software. This is
nothing unique to Ubuntu; it is a characteristic that is applied to all
software. Anything created by humans is subject to error. <br>

<br>

One of the many benefits of the Open Source development process is that
errors and bugs are typically reported, found, and fixed in a far
shorter timeframe than is the case with proprietary software. This
ensures that the software included with Ubuntu is far more solid and
stable than some proprietary alternatives. &nbsp;<br>

Although bugs are typically fixed quickly, there is still the case of
user error. Even if a piece of software is completely bug-free, it can
be used incorrectly, be misconfigured, or otherwise not work as
expected. This is perfectly normal, and the aim of this chapter is to
discuss some of the most common problems faced by users and explore how
to fix or otherwise resolve these issues. <br>

<br>

This chapter is presented in a cookbook format, presenting each problem
followed by a concise solution. If you have read through the other
chapters in the book and not found the solution in this chapter, the
next option is to try the superb Ubuntu Forums at
www.Ubuntuforums.org/. In recent years, the forums have proved to be a
goldmine of useful information. Not only do they include discussion
about problems and issues that other people have, they are also laden
with community contributed how-to articles that cover a wealth of
different areas. <br>

<h2>Before You Begin </h2>

As is the case with most books, there simply isn't room to cover
everything in great detail. Part of the challenge when you face a
problem is in identifying what the cause is, which you can then explore
using the forums, IRC, Web searches and more. In many of the problems
below, we will point you to other resources that provide more
information about fixing the problem. &nbsp;<br>

<h1>Your System </h1>

Your Ubuntu system is a little like an eco-system. For certain things
to work, other things must be already working. When you are new to any
operating system (OS), it can often be a little difficult to get to
know how some of these core system functions work. <br>

<br>

In this section we cover the core system technology in Ubuntu and
problems that can crop up when using it. <br>

<h2>Ubuntu Won't Start! </h2>

When Ubuntu first starts, the GRUB bootloader loads an OS for you. If
you only have Ubuntu installed on your computer, it is loaded
automatically. Otherwise, if you have more than one OS (such as Ubuntu
and Microsoft Windows), you can pick the relevant one from a menu. If
you don't see the menu, restart your computer, wait until you see the
word GRUB, and press Enter. Now use your arrow keys to select an
option. <br>

The core chunk of software that is loaded when Ubuntu starts is the
kernel, and sometimes there are a few different kernels installed on
your system. On the menu, each kernel version (such as 2.6.15) has two
options: the stock kernel and one called "recovery mode." Try booting
the newest nonrecovery mode kernel, and see if your system starts. <br>

<h3>The Bootloader<br>

</h3>

If your system still fails to start, it is likely that your bootloader
is broken. When you use a bootloader such as GRUB, a tiny file (called
the boot sector) is copied into the very first part of your hard disk.
If this file is broken or corrupted, your system often won't boot.
Don't worry though, you can fix this! Restart your computer, and choose
the newest rescue mode option. When using rescue mode, the system
starts in a limited single-user command line mode. You can use this
mode to fix any problems from the command line. In this case, you need
to fix the GRUB bootloader. <br>

<br>

To do this, go to /boot/grub, and load menu.lst in a text editor.
Unfortunately we don't have the space to cover GRUB configuration here,
so it is recommended that you consult the excellent documentation on
the GRUB Web site at www.gnu.org/software/grub/. <br>

<h3>Backing Up and Restoring Your Boot Sector </h3>

When GRUB runs, the boot sector part of your hard disk contains
information about which OS you can boot. This sector sometimes gets
corrupted due to a system crash or power loss and your computer won't
boot. Luckily, with a few carefully chosen commands, you can back up
and restore this important sector. <br>

Back it up using this command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo dd
if=/dev/hda of=MBR-backup bs=512 count=1 </span><br>

<br>

The dd command copies the sector from the first disk (/dev/hda-change
this to your disk) and saves it as MBR-backup in the current directory.
<br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Quick Tip </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">When referring to boot
sectors you may see it prefixed as MBR-this is short for master boot
record. <br>

To restore the sector, run this command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo dd
if=MBR-backup of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1 </span><br>

</div>

<br>

When you boot your computer in rescue mode, you can use these command
to manage your boot sector. <br>

The Ubuntu Logo Appears Corrupted or Just Looks Odd While Booting <br>

When your system starts it uses a special splash image to make the boot
process more attractive, as shown in Figure 6-1. <br>

<br>

<a href="6-1.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 766px; height: 508px;" alt="The Ubuntu Desktop is simple, uncluttered, and...brown" src="6-1.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 6-1 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">The Ubuntu Desktop is
simple, uncluttered, and...brown </span><br>

<br>

If you have problems with this splash screen, you can disable it. To do
this, load the /boot/grub/menu.lst file into a text editor, and scroll
to the bottom of the file. You should see a line such as this: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">kernel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-10-386 root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet splash </span><br>

<br>

Just remove the splash word from the line and restart your computer.
Now plain text boot messages are displayed when the system starts. <br>

<h2>When I Start My Computer I Get Text Instead of a Graphical
Interface </h2>

The graphical interface used in Ubuntu comes in two parts: X and GNOME.
The X server is an underlying chun of software that ensures your
graphics card and monitor work, and it provides a base for GNOME to run
on. The GNOME desktop uses X as an engine to create the rich desktop
platform you have been using. If you start the computer and you can
only see text and no graphical interface, this is a problem with X. <br>

<br>

First reboot your computer to see if that fixes the problem. When your
computer has booted, if you still have the same problem, Ubuntu may
have told you that it cannot start X. If you did not see this message,
press Ctrl-Alt-F7 to see if you can access the graphical interface. If
this does not work, there is a configuration problem with X. <br>

X stores its configuration in /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Before you fiddle
with your configuration, it is always wise to make a backup of the
file. Even if X is not starting, some other parts of the configuration
may be working fine. <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ cd
/etc/X11 </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo cp
xorg.conf xorg.conf.old </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<br>

First you move to the /etc/X11 directory and then you use the cp
command to copy the existing file (xorg.conf) to a backup file
(xorg.conf.old). You now have both an xorg.conf and an xorg.conf.old
with the same information in them. <br>

<br>

Now run the X configuration process: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg </span><br>

<br>

A configuration routine will start, and you should experiment with
different settings in the routine. Unfortunately, we don't have the
space to cover X configuration in detail, so refer to
<a href="https://wiki.Ubuntu.com/DebuggingXAutoconfiguration">https://wiki.Ubuntu.com/DebuggingXAutoconfiguration</a>.
&nbsp;<br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Restricted Drivers </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Ubuntu only ships with
fully Open Source graphics drivers. There are, however, closed source
drivers available for ATI and NVidea cards. For more information about
these drivers, visit the respective manufacturer's Web site. <br>

</div>

<br>

<h2>I Tried to Use a Word or PowerPoint Document, and the Fonts
Are All Wrong </h2>

When loading Microsoft Office documents in OpenOffice.org, the document
may require Windows fonts that are not on your system. Many of these
fonts are available online and can be automatically downloaded with the
msttcorefonts package from the multiverse repository. <br>

<br>

When you install msttcorefonts, it automatically downloads and installs
the following common Windows fonts: <br>

<ul>

  <li>Andale Mono </li>

  <li>Arial Black </li>

  <li>Arial (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic) </li>

  <li>Comic Sans MS (Bold) </li>

  <li>Courier New (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic) </li>

  <li>Georgia (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic) </li>

  <li>Impact </li>

  <li>Times New Roman (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic) </li>

  <li>Trebuchet (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic) </li>

  <li>Verdana (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic) </li>

  <li>Webdings </li>

</ul>

With the installation complete, restart X, and the fonts are available.
<br>

<h2>How Do I Install a Package? </h2>

In Ubuntu, all components (applications, documentation, artwork, etc.)
are split up into separate packages. Each package serves one purpose.
For instance the package Firefox contains Mozilla Firefox, and
Ubuntu-audio contains the Ubuntu default audio theme. <br>

<br>

To install a program, select Applications &gt; Add/Remove. When
asked for a password, enter your login password. Select a category in
the left pane. This corresponds to the Applications menu. Click an
empty checkbox for any application you want in the upper right pane to
select it for installation. Or deinstall an application by deselecting
the application's checkbox. Nothing will actually happen until you
click Apply or OK. A dialog box lists the pending changes, and if you
click OK the required packages are downloaded and installed (or
deinstalled if that's what you chose). When it's finished, click Close.
<br>

<br>

If you can't find what you're looking for, enter a word into the search
box in the upper right corner. For instance if you enter "picture," it
will show the GIMP, a powerful tool to edit pictures. You can also
search for a specific application, such as Patience. <br>

<br>

When you still can't find it, or you want to install a package not
listed in Add/Remove, click the Advanced button. You can also open
Synaptic by selecting System &gt; Administration &gt; Synaptic
Package Manager. Enter your login password if prompted. <br>

<br>

First click the Reload button on the toolbar to download the latest
package lists. To search for a package, click Search on the toolbar.
For example, enter "Tux Paint," and click Search. Successive search
queries are stored in the left pane, and the results are shown in the
right pane. To install a package, click the box to the left of the
name. Select Mark for Installation from the list. Synaptic will warn
when other packages (dependencies) have to be installed for the package
you want to install. Click Mark to automatically mark the required
packages for installation. The package you've selected is highlighted
in green. Packages marked for removal appear in red. For Tux Paint, you
see two other packages highlighted in green. Other required packages
marked for installation do not appear in the search results for Tux
Paint, because they are not specifically made for Tux Paint, and hence
can also be used by other applications. <br>

<br>

To browse for packages click Components in the lower left corner. The
categories presented in the left pane are not corresponding to the
Applications menu. The "universe" and "multiverse" categories hold
packages not supported by Ubuntu. It is advisable only to install them
if you know what you are doing. <br>

<br>

When you have selected a package, a description is shown in the bottom
pane. To obtain more detailed information (such as the download and
installed size), click Properties on the toolbar. <br>

<br>

When you are done marking packages, click Apply on the toolbar. This
opens a dialog where you can see the pending changes. If you are sure,
click Apply. The required packages are then downloaded and installed.
When it's finished, click close. &nbsp;<br>

<h2>I Want to Install an Application That Is Not In Synaptic </h2>

Although Synaptic contains a huge selection of packages, sometimes the
package you need is not included. The first thing you should check is
that you have enabled the additional repositories such as universe and
multiverse. Open Synaptic from System &gt; Administration &gt;
Synaptic Package Manager. Now click Settings &gt; Repositories
&gt; Add. Ensure that all of the Components check-boxes are
selected. See <a href="https://wiki.Ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto">https://wiki.Ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto</a>
for more
details. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">The Repository Run-Down </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The universe repository
contains the thousands of packages that are part of the Debian
distribution, upon which Ubuntu is based. All of these packages are
entirely free and supported by a community of Ubuntu contributors. <br>

The multiverse repository contains a number of packages that are freely
available to download but are not fully Open Source. If you only want
to run Open Source software, you may not want to use this repository. <br>

</div>

<br>

If you have enabled these extra repositories and your package is still
not there, have a quick hunt around with a search engine to see if you
can find a repository (known as a Debian or APT repository) for your
package. If you find one, use the Repositories dialog box you have just
played with to add the new repository, and then use Synaptic to install
the package. <br>

<br>

If no repository is available, look for a Debian package (.deb) for the
application. If you find one, download it, and double-click it to
install. If no Debian Package exists, look for an Autopackage. (Details
about Autopackage installation are in the next section.) <br>

<br>

Finally, if all else fails, download the source code and compile it. <br>

<h2>Nautilus Is Painfully Slow-How Can I Make It Run Faster? </h2>

There are a number of options you can deactivate to make using Nautilus
a faster process. First, click Edit &gt; Preferences, find the tab
marked Preview, and click on it. If Show Text in Icons (the first
option) is enabled it will preview some of the contents of text
documents in their icons. Set this option to Never. Next, there's an
option called Show Thumbnails. This option will preview image files as
thumbnails. Set this option to Never to further improve the speed of
Nautilus browsing. If enabled, the option Preview Sound Files will make
it possible to preview sound files without actually opening them. Set
this to Never as well. The last option, Count Number of Items, shows
how many items are within the folders listed in the directory you're
currently browsing. Set this to Never. <br>

<br>

If you are still not satisfied with the speed of Nautilus, you could
check out some other file managers, such as Rox Filer or Thunar. <br>

<h2>Add TrueType Fonts to Your Desktop Quickly </h2>

Fonts have a huge impact on how attractive and usable your desktop is.
Although Ubuntu comes with a range of high quality fonts, you may want
to install some additional fonts. This is often the case when you need
to use a specific company font. On modern OS, most fonts come in the
form of TrueType fonts. Ubuntu offers full support for TrueType fronts,
and it is simple to add new fonts. <br>

To add a font, press Alt+F2. In the resulting dialog box type
fonts:///, and press Enter. A font folder opens up such as that seen in
Figure 6-2. Drag and drop your new font(s) to the folder that opens up.<br>

<br>

<a href="6-2.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 835px; height: 531px;" alt="Installing fonts is as simple as dropping them in the font directory." src="6-2.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 6-2 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Installing fonts is as simple as dropping them in the font directory. </span><br>

<br>

To check to see if the new fonts are installed, press Alt+F2, and in
the dialog box type ~/.fonts. You should see your new font in the
folder that appears. Try out the new font in an application such as
GIMP. You will have to restart open applications before they detect the
new fonts. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Note </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If you perform these steps
as an ordinary user, the fonts will only be available to your user
account. <br>

</div>

<h2>How Can I Test That an ISO File Works? </h2>

Whenever you download a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu, you will
typically download an .iso file, a file that contains an image of a CD.
This file is then used to create an installation CD that can be used to
install the distribution. After downloading the file you may want to
first check that the file works and, second, verify that the file is a
legitimate download. <br>

<h3>Checking That&nbsp; the ISO Works </h3>

Open a terminal, and then go to the folder where the ISO image has been
downloaded. As an example, if you saved it to your disk in Firefox, it
will have saved it to the Desktop folder in your home folder: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ cd
Desktop </span><br>

<br>

To test that the ISO image works, you are going to mount it and access
the files in a particular folder. First, create this folder: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ mkdir
test_iso </span><br>

<br>

Now mount it on that folder: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
mount -o loop -t iso9660 my_iso_file.iso test_iso </span><br>

<br>

That's it! Now you can browse the folder test_iso. <br>

<h3>Verifying the ISO </h3>

To verify the iso, fire up a terminal, and run the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ md5sum
my_iso_file.iso </span><br>

<br>

Wait a little while and Ubuntu will print a "word" that is 33
characters long. Now go to the site&nbsp; from which you downloaded
the file, and compare this word with the md5sum given by the owner of
the iso file, usually a file named MD5SUMS. The words should match.
&nbsp;<br>

<h2>I Downloaded an Autopackage But I Don't Know How to Run It </h2>

Autopackages are software packages that install on any Linux
distribution, including Ubuntu. Autopackages offer an ideal way of
installing software on your system that is not available via Synaptic.
If you need something Synaptic can't offer, Autopackages are a great
alternative. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Replacing an Application
with an Autopackage </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If you are running an
existing application that was installed via Synaptic, and you want to
replace it with an Autopackage, make sure that you uninstall the
application first with Synaptic. Autopackage does not work in
conjunction with Synaptic, so ensure that you remove any applications
before you install the Autopackage. <br>

</div>

<br>

When you find an Autopackage that you want to install, download it to
your desktop. Now, right-click the package, and select Properties. In
the Permissions tab, select the Execute checkbox on the Owner row. Now
close the dialog box, and double-click the package. <br>

<br>

The installation program now begins, and you can just follow the
on-screen instructions. <br>

<h2>How Do I Compile an Application? </h2>

When a distribution package is not available, the source code is always
available to compile with Open Source applications. Compilation is the
process of converting programming code into a program that you can run
and use. Although it sounds like a devilishly difficult process, it is
typically fairly simple. &nbsp;<br>

<br>

You should first have a look on the application's Web page, or in the
INSTALL or README file that is included with the code to see what
software the application needs to run. When you know what is required,
use Synaptic to search for the required tools. Many of the requirements
will be software libraries (software that applications require to run),
and these libraries typically have "lib" at the start of the package
name. As an example, if you need to have the Vorbis audio codec
installed, do a search in Synaptic for Vorbis, and libvorbis will be
one of the packages. You should also install with -dev at the end of
the package name (such as libvorbis-dev). These packages allow you to
compile software for that library. <br>

<br>

The process of compiling software involves three steps: 1)
configuration, 2) compilation, and 3) installation. Open a terminal,
move into the directory from which you extracted the source code, and
configure it: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:yourapp$
./configure </span><br>

<br>

When you run ./configure, it checks to see that you have all the
required software. If it throws an error, it is likely that a required
tool or library is missing. Find out what it is, and install it.
Typically, configure will tell you what you need to install. <br>

<br>

If the configure script works fine, compile the code with this command:
<br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:yourapp$
make </span><br>

<br>

If a problem appears when compiling the software, it may be a bug or
problem in the source code. It is best to refer your problem to the
author of the code for further help. <br>

If the compile process was successful, install the application with
this command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:yourapp$
sudo make install </span><br>

<br>

The software is now fully installed. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Quick Tip </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If you want to ensure you
have all the right tools installed to build your application, run the
following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
apt-get build-dep packagename </span><br>

</div>

<br>

<h2>I Can't See the Hidden Dot Files and Folders in the File
Manager </h2>

Files and directories that begin with a dot (such as .openoffice2) are
typically used to store settings and configuration details for a
particular application. By default, the file manager does not show
these files. So how do you view, move, and copy them? Simple. Just
click View &gt; Show Hidden Files, or press Ctrl-H and your hidden
files are displayed, as shown in Fig 6-3. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Warning! </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Don't ever mess around
with hidden files and directories unless you know exactly what you are
doing. Making the wrong move with one of these files or directories
could break something! <br>

</div>

<br>

<a href="6-3.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 835px; height: 531px;" alt="Displaying hidden files can be useful when you need to edit them." src="6-3.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Displaying hidden files can be useful when you need to edit them. </span><br>

<h2>How Do I Restore Something I Deleted in the File Manager? </h2>

When you delete something in Ubuntu, the files are not deleted
immediately and are instead moved to the wastebasket. If you
accidentally deleted your important report and want to avoid limb
removal by your boss, open the wastebasket by double-clicking the small
wastebasket icon in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, and
then drag your files back into the file manager. The world now returns
to the happy place it was before you accidentally deleted your files. <br>

<h2>The Desktop Has Hung-What Do I Do? </h2>

In the rare situation that the desktop hangs, first try and restart it
by pressing Alt-Ctrl-Backspace at the same time. This kills and
restarts the X server. Another method of killing the X server is to
press Alt+F2 to jump to a terminal, log in, and then run this command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$
/etc/init.d/gdm stop </span><br>

<br>

This command stops the graphical login screen, which in turn stops the
X server. You can restart it with this command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$
/etc/init.d/gdm start </span><br>

<h2>My Screen Resolution Is Wrong </h2>

If your screen resolution is incorrect, click System &gt;
Preferences &gt; Screen Resolution, and select a new resolution
from the combo box. <br>

<br>

If the box does not show the resolution that you want, refer to the
recipe showing how to reconfigure your X server. <br>

<h2>How Can I Automatically Login Without Having to Enter My
Login Details? </h2>

If logging in is a drag for you, click System &gt; Administration
&gt; Login Screen Setup, and select the Login a User automatically
on first bootup checkbox. In the checkbox below it, select the user who
should be logged in automatically. <br>

<br>

Be careful when automatically logging in-anyone will have access to the
computer when it is started. If you would prefer certain people not
have access to the computer, automatically logging in may not be such a
good idea. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Automatically Logging in
Root </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">In the Security tab of the
window, you can allow root to login automatically. Although possible,
this is not recommended due to the security implications. Automating a
root login could allow anyone to tamper with your computer-so be
careful! <br>

</div>

<h2>I Tried to Upgrade My System, but I Get an Error </h2>

If you try to install some software or upgrade your computer, and you
get an error, the package manager may have tied itself in a knot. To
try and resolve this, open a terminal, and run the following commands: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
apt-get update </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
apt-get -f install </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<br>

The first command updates your package list, and the second command
tries to fix your package manager. If this is successful the packages
that failed will be installed correctly. <br>

In addition to these commands, you can reconfigure any packages that
have not yet been configured by running: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo dpkg
-configure -pending</span><br>

<h2>I Am Running Out of Disk Space-How Do I Free Up Some Space? </h2>

If you are concerned you may be running out of disk space, there are a
few techniques that you can use to clear some room. Before you do
anything you should get a report of how much disk space is available.
Load up a terminal, and run the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ df -h </span><br>

<br>

The df command prints a listing of the free space on your disk. By
passing it the -h option, more readable file sizes are displayed (e.g.,
9.5G as opposed to 9887776). In addition to the file size, a percentage
of how much space is left is displayed. If the line with / in the
Mounted On column is nearing 100 percent, you need to clear some room.
The / partition is where most of the software is installed. <br>

<br>

The first thing you should do is to clean out your package cache. Every
time a package is downloaded with Synaptic or with the automatic
upgrade manager, it is stored in /var/cache/apt/archives/. You can
clean out these packages without affecting your system. Just run the
following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
apt-get clean </span><br>

<br>

With the package cache cleaned, you should now look for the largest
directories on your system. This is where the command line can really
come into its own. Run the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ du -h
/home | sort -nr | less </span><br>

<br>

The du command lists disk usage for the /home directory (where users
store their files). Again, the -h option makes the sizes more readable.
The output of this command is fed into sort which organizes the output
numerically (-n) and reverses the order (-r) to display the largest
files first. Finally, the output is fed into less, which lets you
scroll up and down through the listing. <br>

<br>

Find the largest directories, and remove any unwanted files by either
using the graphical file manager or the rm command. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">A Graphical Option </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A useful little tool
called Baobab can be installed to provide a graphical means of
exploring hard disk usage. Baobab also includes a script for Nautilus
so that you can right-click a folder to use Baobab to explore that
folder. Baobab is packaged and ready to install for Ubuntu-just use
Synaptic to download and install it. &nbsp;<br>

</div>

<br>

<h2>I Deleted Something in the File Manager, but I Don't See the
Extra Disk Space </h2>

When you delete files in the file manager, they are copied to the
wastebasket. To finally delete them, right-click the wastebasket in the
bottom right-hand corner of the screen, and click Empty the
Wastebasket. A dialog box pops up asking you to confirm the deletion.
Click the Empty the Wastebasket button, and the files are removed. <br>

Another Version of Ubuntu is Out-How Do I Upgrade to It? <br>

<br>

If a new version of Ubuntu is released, the update manager will notify
you via an upgrade notification pop-up bubble. To upgrade, click the
Upgrade button, and follow the instructions. <br>

<br>

If you want to manually upgrade, first find out the codename for the
next version of Ubuntu (in the same vain as Warty, Hoary, Breezy, and
Dapper). Now open /etc/apt/sources.list, and replace the word "dapper"
with the new codeword. Now run: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
apt-get updates</span> <br>

<br>

This command updated your package list. Now upgrade the system: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
apt-get dist-upgrade </span><br>

<br>

You are asked if you wish to continue. Press Y, and then press Enter to
continue. Your entire system is now upgraded. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">As Usual... </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Remember to back up all
your important files before doing a distribution upgrade! <br>

</div>

<br>

<h1>Applications </h1>

Applications are the lifeblood of any desktop computer, but they are
also packed with configuration options, different types of
functionality, and other things that could possibly trip you up. This
section covers some of the common application-oriented problems in
Ubuntu. <br>

<h2>When I Click the Close Window Icon My Program Doesn't Go Away
</h2>

If your application seems to hang, and the window won't go away keep
clicking the X icon. After a few seconds a dialog box should appear to
indicate the program has become inactive and asking if you want to
close it. <br>

If this does not work, you can use xkill to stop it. Press Alt+F2, type
xkill, and press Enter. Your mouse cursor changes to a small skull and
crossbones. Click the offending application window, and it will finally
be banished to that place where naughty applications wallow. <br>

<h2>The Upgrade Notification Bubble Keeps Appearing, and I Want
It to Stop </h2>

When your system detects new upgrades are available, a small bubble
appears in the notification area. To switch this off, right-click the
upgrades icon, and deselect the Show Notifications option. <br>

<h2>Extending Nautilus with Scripts </h2>

The file manager driving your Ubuntu desktop is called Nautilus. This
comprehensive tool is not only packaged with features out of the box,
but also has the ability to be extended and improved with the use of
special scripts. <br>

A Nautilus script is just an executable shell script (usually using the
default Ubuntu bash shell) that is placed in a special scripts
directory so that the Nautilus graphical shell can find it. This is a
really neat function of Nautilus, because it allows you to extend the
functionality of the file browser to do just about anything. <br>

Scripts are invoked by selecting a file or group of files and
right-clicking with the mouse to bring up a Context menu. One of the
options of this menu is the Scripts submenu, which allows you to select
a script to invoke on the selected files. <br>

<h3>Installing a Script </h3>

For a script to appear on the Script submenu, it must be placed in your
scripts directory and be executable. If you place an executable script
in your scripts directory, its name will not necessarily appear on the
Scripts menu immediately. You first must visit the scripts directory
with Nautilus by using the last option in the Scripts menu. Once the
directory is visited, Nautilus will know about which scripts you have,
and you will be able to use them. The current location of the scripts
directory is .GNOME2/Nautilus-scripts in your home directory. &nbsp;<br>

<h3>A Sample Nautilus Script </h3>

To get you started with Nautilus scripts, we will look at an example
script. This script pops up a window to ask for a folder location and
then loads Nautilus at that location. It's a simple example, but it
shows you how to create a script and run it. <br>

<br>

Open your favorite text editor, and paste the following code into a new
file: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">#! /bin/bash </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;"># </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;"># GoTo script for
Nautilus scripts </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;"># by ardchoille </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;"># This script is
released under the GPL </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;"># February 20, 2006 </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;"># </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">mylocation=`zenity
-entry -text="Enter the desired location:" </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">-width=300
-title="Nautilus location"` </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">Nautilus -no-desktop
-browser $mylocation </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">exit </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<br>

Save the new file to your Nautilus scripts directory with the filename
of "GoTo." (You can use any filename really.) Now make the new script
executable with: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ chmod a+x
filename </span><br>

<br>

Right-click in Nautilus, and choose Scripts&nbsp;
&gt;&nbsp; GoTo, and you will be presented with a zenity dialog
that asks for a valid path. After entering the path, click the OK
button, and Nautilus will open with the specified path. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">For More Fun and Games... </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Install the
Nautilus-actions package to add an extension to Nautilus for
configuring programs to be launched depending on Nautilus selections. <br>

</div>

<h2>I Went to a Web Site in Firefox, and the Macromedia Flash
Plug-in is Missing </h2>

If you visit a Web site in Firefox and the flash plug-in is required, a
small bar appears indicating that you need to install an additional
plug-in. To do this, click the Install Missing Plug-ins button, and
follow the instructions. When the program has downloaded and installed
the plug-in, restart Firefox, and you are all set. <br>

<h2>Java is Not Installed on My System </h2>

To run a Java application on your system or access a Java Web site in
Firefox, you need to install the Java libraries first. To do this, fire
up Synaptic, and install the j2re1.4 and j2re1.4-mozilla-plug-in
packages. <br>

If you want to run a version of Java not included with Ubuntu, refer to
<a href="https://wiki.Ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats">https://wiki.Ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats</a>
<br>

<h2>I Have Heard Desktop Search is Cool-How Do I Install It? </h2>

In recent months, desktop search has gained more and more coverage in
different parts of the media. With the release of Mac OS X Tiger and
speculation about WinFS in Windows Vista, more hype was piled on to the
desktop search bonfire. You will be pleased to know that Linux users
don't miss out either. <br>

The idea behind desktop search is that all files on your desktop are
automatically indexed. When you create or remove a file, the index is
updated. With this kind of functionality, you can use a single search
interface to look for anything on your system. <br>

<br>

The Linux implementation of desktop search is called Beagle. Beagle is
still very much in development and, as such, is not included by default
in Ubuntu. To install Beagle select the Beagle package from
Applications &gt; Add/Remove Applications. Beagle not only indexes
the name and contents of your files, it also indexes e-mails in
Evolution, instant messaging conversations in Gaim, blogs, Web pages,
and more. <br>

To perform a search click Applications &gt; Accessories &gt;
Beagle Search, and type in your search term. Press Enter, and you will
see the results such as those displayed in Figure 6-4. <br>

<br>

<a href="6-4.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 710px; height: 579px;" alt="Beagle is simple and useful." src="6-4.png"></a><br>

<br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">All Hail the Deskbar </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If you install Beagle and
find that you like it, you should also install the deskbar package.
This small panel applet provides a convenient means to search for all
kinds of different things on your computer. It is simple, convenient,
and reliable. <br>

</div>

<h2>My E-mail Doesn't Work in Evolution </h2>

When you first run Evolution it runs through the setup procedure to
configure your e-mail address. To do this successfully, you need to
have the following details available: <br>

<ul>

  <li>Your type of e-mail server (such as POP or IMAP) </li>

  <li>Your mail server name (such as mail.chin.com) </li>

  <li>Your mail account's username and password </li>

  <li>Authentication type (typically password) </li>

  <li>Your outgoing mail server type (typically SMTP) </li>

  <li>Your outgoing mail server name </li>

</ul>

If you have configured your account and your e-mail doesn't work,
click&nbsp; Edit &gt; Preferences, select the account from the
list, and click the Edit button. Ensure that the settings above are all
correct. If you still cannot connect to your e-mail server, there is
either a configuration problem or a network problem. <br>

<br>

The latter problem would mean one of two things: your computer is not
connected to the network, or the mail server is not connected to the
network. To test this, run the following command in a terminal: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ ping
mail.chin.com </span><br>

<br>

Replace mail.chin.com with the name of your mail server. The ping
command sends a few pieces of information to the server to see if it
responds. If it does respond, a series of lines will be displayed with
a response time. If you get this, your network is running fine, and the
problem is likely to be a configuration error. <br>

<br>

A configuration error can either be on your computer or the mail server
itself, with your computer being the far more likely candidate. You
should get in touch with the person who runs the mail server and
confirm that your settings above are correct. Also check that the mail
server is running fine. If the configuration error is on the mail
server side, there is nothing you can do until it is fixed. In this
case, ask the administrator to let you know when it is fixed. <br>

<br>

When you find out the correct configuration settings, enter them into
Evolution and try again. <br>

<h1>Multimedia </h1>

Multimedia is playing an increasingly import role in modern desktops,
and most people like to listen music, watch movies, and watch videos on
their desktop. Unfortunately, multimedia has had something of a
checkered history in the Linux world due to the licensing problems with
the all important codecs&nbsp; that are required to view and hear
your media. This section explores some of common problems faced with
multimedia and your Ubuntu desktop. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Restricted Formats </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">You can get further help
and guidance on restricted media formats that don't ship with Ubuntu by
visiting <a href="https://wiki.Ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats">https://wiki.Ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats</a>.
&nbsp;<br>

</div>

<h2>I Downloaded a Particular Media File, and It Won't Play </h2>

Included with Ubuntu are Open Source codecs such as Ogg Vorbis and Ogg
Theora, but the vast majority of media on the Internet uses
restrictively licensed codecs such as MP3, Windows Media, QuickTime,
and others. <br>

Ubuntu does not ship these codecs for legal and philosophical reasons.
Not only would shipping the codecs possibly breach the original
license, but Ubuntu is fundamentally oriented around a totally free and
Open Source desktop. <br>

<br>

There are methods for playing these media formats, and if you want to
install them, refer to the Ubuntu Forums for more details. <br>

<h2>My DVD Won't Play </h2>

As with the previous problem, DVD playback is also a somewhat
restricted process that requires special software to be installed. The
software is available if needed. Again, refer to the Ubuntu Forums for
more details. <br>

<h2>DVD Playback is Jittery and Jumpy </h2>

When you watch DVD movies on your computer, you may find that they are
jittery and unstable. In most cases the problem is that direct memory
access (DMA) mode in your DVD drive is not enabled. By enabling this
mode, your problems should disappear. <br>

<br>

Check if DMA mode is enabled by running this command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
/sbin/hdparm /dev/hdc | grep dma</span> <br>

<br>

Most DVD drives are /dev/hdc, but change the letter if yours is
different. If DMA mode is not enabled, you will see this: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">using_dma
=&nbsp; 1 (on)</span> <br>

<br>

To turn on DMA mode, run this command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
/sbin/hdparm -d1 /dev/hdc</span> <br>

<br>

Now try to play your DVD. <br>

<br>

If this solves your problems, you should edit /etc/hdparm.conf and add
the following block: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">/dev/hdc { </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
dma&nbsp; = on </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">} </span><br>

<h2>When I Start Some Applications Ubuntu Says I Don't Have
Access to <span style="font-family: monospace;">/dev/dsp</span>
</h2>

There are literally hundreds of thousands of applications for the Linux
system, and many of them have different requirements and dependencies.
One area in which this can be a problem is audio software. Each audio
application relies on one of many sound servers: pieces of software
that manage communication with the sound card. These sound servers come
in many forms, including esd, gstreamer, arts, and jack. <br>

<br>

In Ubuntu, esd is the default sound server. Although the multimedia
applications included with your desktop work fine, some other
applications (such as Audacity shown in Fig 6-5) may complain when you
start them that something else has access to /dev/dsp. To solve this
click Applications &gt; System Tools &gt; System Monitor. In
the list of processes click on esd, and click the End Process button.
By stopping esd you can now use the application. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">But Remember... </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Of course, by killing esd,
those applications that require esd will not run. To use those
applications (such as the default multimedia application included in
Ubuntu) start esd by pressing Alt+F2 and typing esd into the textbox.
You will hear some beeps to indicate esd is now running. <br>

</div>

<br>

<a href="6-5.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 962px; height: 658px;" alt="Audacity is a typical application that requires this recipe." src="6-5.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 6-5 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Audacity is a typical application that requires this recipe. </span><br>

<h2>My Microphone Doesn't Work </h2>

Although it seems like an obvious first point to check, ensure that you
have plugged your microphone into the right socket. Many computers
include a number of audio inputs/outputs, and they can be easily
confused. In recent years a number of hardware manufacturers seem to
have gone out of their way to poorly mark these sockets, so don't worry
if you get them mixed up. If in doubt, consult your manual. <br>

<br>

With the microphone properly plugged in, load up the recording level
monitor by clicking Applications &gt; Sound and Video
&gt;&nbsp; Recording Level Monitor, and speak into your
microphone. If you see nothing appearing on the scale, you need to turn
on and adjust the volume of your microphone. To do this, right-click
the volume icon in the notification area, and select Open Volume
Control. Inside the dialog that pops up, click the Capture tab, make
sure the microphone sliders are near the top and that the small
microphone icon does not have a red cross on it. This icon mutes the
devices, and clicking it toggles it. <br>

<br>

Now speak into the microphone, and you should see the recording level
monitor flash. To record your voice click Applications &gt;
Accessories &gt; Sound Recorder. <br>

<h2>How Do I Change the Visual Theme? </h2>

To change the way your Ubuntu desktop looks, click System &gt;
Preferences &gt; Theme, and you will see Figure 6-6. <br>

<br>

<a href="6-6.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 621px; height: 486px;" alt="Changing themes is simple - click it, and it changes!" src="6-6.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 6-6 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Changing themes is simple - click it, and it changes! </span><br>

<br>

From there, you can select predefined themes or click details to create
a custom theme. Changes are applied immediately. If you click Details,
you get a dialog box with three tabs. All themes are separated into
three parts: the elements (buttons, text fields, etc.), the window
frame (the title bar), and icons. If you have downloaded new themes,
drag them into the theme details window, and click Install. When you
are done, click Close. <br>

<h2>How Do I Find and Install New Desktop Themes and Backgrounds?
</h2>

We all love tweaking our desktops so they look individual to our own
tastes and preferences. Luckily the desktop is very flexible in how it
can be visually configured. To make this as simple as possible, the
GNOME Art Web site was created to host a huge array of wallpapers and
themes. You can use the site to spruce up your desktop. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Art Web Sites </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">There are a number of
sites that help make your desktop look pretty. See
<a href="http://art.ubuntu.com">http://art.ubuntu.com</a>,
<a href="http://art.gnome.org">http://art.gnome.org</a>
or <a href="http://gnome-look.org">http://gnome-look.org</a>.
&nbsp;<br>

</div>

<br>

To make this even easier, there is a tool called art manager that can
be used to find new themes and backgrounds, but it is not installed by
default. To install it, use Synaptic to install GNOME-art. After it is
installed, click System &gt; Preferences &gt; Art Manager to
load it. <br>

<br>

To find desktop backgrounds click Art &gt; Backgrounds &gt;
All. If you don't want to see GNOME backgrounds, click Art &gt;
Backgrounds &gt; Other. Alternatively, if you only want GNOME
backgrounds, click Art &gt; Backgrounds &gt; GNOME. The art
manager downloads thumbnails and descriptions of all available
backgrounds. The latest backgrounds are at the bottom of the list.
Select one from the list. To show the background in detail, click
Preview. To install it, click Install. The change background window
then shows the installed background. From there you can optionally
change its style. When you're done, click Finish to get back to the art
manager. <br>

To find desktop theme elements click Art &gt; Desktop themes
&gt; Application. The latest are at the bottom. To see a sample
window displaying the selected theme, click Preview. To install the
theme, click Install. Then from the Theme preferences window, click
Theme-details, and select the new elements from the list. Click both
Close buttons to go back to the art manager. <br>

<br>

Finding new window borders and icon themes works similarly. You can
also install splash screens and login screens, but the former are not
used by default in Ubuntu (though they can be enabled in the session
manager), and the latter cannot be installed directly. GTK+ engines are
seldom used. None of the applications that are installed by default use
it. <br>

<h2>How Do I Turn My Ubuntu Computer Into a MythTV Box? </h2>

MythTV is a collection of applications that can convert a computer into
a full fledged media center with the capability to pause live TV,
record shows, play music, play videos, play DVDs, access weather
information, and more. More details about MythTV are available at
www.mythtv.org/. MythTV also goes to great lengths to look like a
normal TV device and not like a computer plugged into a TV (see Figure
6-7 for an example). <br>

<br>

<a href="6-7.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 720px; height: 576px;" alt="MythTV makes TV so much more fun!" src="6-7.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 6-7 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
MythTV makes TV so much more fun! </span><br>

<br>

To install a full MythTV system, install each of the mythtv packages
that are available in Synaptic. You also need to install a few other
packages: <br>

<ul>

  <li>xmltv: This is used to grab TV listings in XML formatting </li>

  <li>DVD support: To watch DVDs you should refer to the Ubuntu
Wiki and install the relevant packages </li>

  <li>lirc: Install this if you want to use a remote control </li>

</ul>

MythTV comes in two major parts: the front-end and the back-end. The
backend is used to perform the grunt work such as recording and
processing shows, and the front-end provides an attractive user
interface. With this architecture you could run the backend on a bulky,
noisy machine elsewhere in the house and run the front-end on a
fanless, attractive little machine in your living room. <br>

<br>

Unfortunately, we don't have the space to cover the configuration of
MythTV. Instead refer to the Ubuntu Forums. <br>

<h1>Networking </h1>

There are few modern computers that are not on the Internet now. With
such an important feature, having a networking problem can feel like a
crippling blow, particularly for those of us who spend extended periods
of time staring at a Web browser. This section identifies some of the
common problems with wired and wireless networking. <br>

<h2>I Can't Access My LAN </h2>

First check that the cables for your network are plugged in correctly.
On many hubs, a small light appears when a cable is plugged into one of
the sockets. Many Ethernet cards also display a connection light too. <br>

Next check if the card has been recognized by the system. To find out,
fire up the Networking tool by clicking System-Administration &gt;
Networking, and you should see an icon displayed in the window that
represents your network card. If there is no icon, your card has not
been detected and loaded by Ubuntu. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">How to Find Out If Your
Device is Supported </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If your device is not
currently supported, search through the Ubuntu Wiki
(<a href="http://wiki.ubuntu.com/">http://wiki.ubuntu.com/</a>)
and the Ubuntu Forums
(<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/">http://ubuntuforums.org/</a>).
Searching for the name and model of your
device is most likely to return some results. Alternatively, do a Web
search for your device and Linux or Ubuntu to see if any generic
support is being worked on. <br>

<br>

</div>

In the Networking tool, double-check that your settings are correct.
You can check if your network card is working and has an interface by
opening a terminal with Applications &gt; Accessories &gt;
Terminal and typing: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ ifconfig </span><br>

<br>

You should see a number of blocks such as eth0 or ra0. One of these
blocks should have a local IP address. The format of this address
depends on which IP range is on your network. The&nbsp; range
192.168.0.n where n is a number between 1 and 254 is commonly used. If
you see an IP address in your ifconfig output, try pinging the IP that
you set as the gateway. If you did not set a gateway (typically when
you obtain your IP address automatically with DHCP), your IP address is
likely to be 192.168.0.1. Try to send packets to this IP: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ ping
192.168.0.1 </span><br>

<br>

Change the IP address if your IP range is different. If you get a
number of lines with a time = attribute at the end, your network card
works. <br>

If you have set up your network card to automatically grab an IP
address with DHCP, you can get a new address by running the following
command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
dhclient </span><br>

<h3>Nameserver Problems </h3>

A common problem that users often face is that the connection to your
network is working, but the addresses for the nameservers are
incorrect. A nameserver (also known as a DNS server) converts Web
addresses (such as www.Ubuntu.com) into the numeric IP address that is
used to access the site. <br>

<br>

If you have a working connection but cannot access domains, it is
certainly a nameserver problem. To test this, you will need to know an
IP address. You may have been given some IP addresses for different
services from your ISP. Alternatively, you can use another computer to
find an IP address with which to test. Try pinging the address, and if
you get pings back you know its a nameserver problem. To resolve this,
specify the correct nameservers in the DNS tab. <br>

<h2>How Do I Use ssh (Secure SHell) for Transferring Files Across
a Network? </h2>

Secure shell is a protocol for connecting to remote computers in a safe
way. To connect on the client side to a remote computer, click
Locations &gt; Connect to Server, and choose SSH as the service
type. In the first field, enter the host name or IP address of the
remote computer. <br>

<br>

The folder field can be left blank but can be used to go straight into
a folder when you open the connection in the file manager. For
instance, the home folder of user joe is typically /home/joe. Other
folders are still accessible by clicking the up button on the toolbar.
Enter the username of the user on the remote computer in the username
field. If it's the same as the local username, just leave it blank.
Both the folder field and the username field are case sensitive. Click
Connect to proceed. &nbsp;<br>

<br>

The first time you connect, a question appears that says the identity
of the remote computer is yet unknown. This is normal. Click the Login
Anyway button to proceed. If you are asked for a password, enter the
password of the user on the remote computer. Click on remember password
for this session and Connect. If the password was wrong or it took too
long to enter the password, it is asked again. <br>

<br>

The connection appears on the desktop. If you chose not to remember the
password for the session or in the key chain, you may be asked again.
Now you can use the remote files the same way you use them locally. You
can even copy files across different ssh connections and other network
protocols such as FTP. <br>

<h2>How Do I Use a Graphical Application Remotely with ssh
(Secure SHell)? </h2>

To connect on the client side to the remote computer, first open a
terminal. Click Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal
Window. Now run this command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ ssh -X
user@host </span><br>

&nbsp;<br>

where user is the user name on the remote computer, and host is the
host name or IP address. If the user name is the same, leave out the
user@ part. -X here signals ssh that you want to run graphical
applications. Make sure you use capitals exactly as shown. Usernames
are also case sensitive. <br>

<br>

If it's the first time you are connecting, you will get a warning
similar to the following: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">The authenticity of
host '251.152.123.101' (251.152.123.101)' can't be established. </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">RSA key fingerprint
is 01:12:23:34:45:56:67:78:89:9a:ab:bc:cd:de:ef:ff. </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">Are you sure you
want to continue connecting (yes/no)? </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<br>

Type Yes, and press Enter. When asked for a password, enter the
password of the user on the remote computer. Now you should have a
shell on the remote computer, and it's possible to run commands
remotely. <br>

You can try for example Firefox to open up Mozilla Firefox, or Gaim to
have a chat with yourself. <br>

<h2>My Wireless Card is Not Working </h2>

One of the greatest new features for laptop users in Ubuntu is
network-manager. With this shiny new application it is finally easy to
connect your Ubuntu system to any wireless network. Where previously
you had to jump through hoops to do WPA or 802.1x authentication,
network-manager makes this completely transparent. <br>

<br>

Simply click on the network-manager icon to see all available wireless
networks, and click on the network to connect to it. If wireless
authentication is needed, be it WEP, WPA or 802.1x, a network-manager
dialog will pop up asking for your authentication details. <br>

<br>

Of course, these improvements are not limited to laptop or even desktop
users. Even for machines without a GUI networking has been made easy by
the Debian and Ubuntu developers who integrated WPA authentication into
the standard network configuration system. <br>

<br>

If network-manager does not solve the problem, the first step should be
to see which driver your wireless card needs. Do a search for your card
on Google and in the Ubuntu Forums to find out which driver you need.
Many of the drivers are already included in Ubuntu, but some newer
drivers may not be present. <br>

Next, you need to find out if the driver is loaded. As an example, if
you have an Intel Centrino and it uses the ipw2200 driver, run this
command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
lsmod | grep ipw2200 </span><br>

<br>

Replace ipw2200 with the relevant driver for your card. If you get some
lines returned, the driver is loaded and working. If nothing is
returned, your card is either not supported or the driver is not
included in Ubuntu. You should refer to the Ubuntu Forums for further
support. <br>

With the card identified, you now need to get connected. The easiest
way to do this is to select System &gt; Administration &gt;
Networking. Inside this tool you should see an icon for your wireless
card. Select it and click the Properties button. Now add the name of
the wireless network and a password if applicable. If you are using a
normal password such as s3cr3tpass, select Plain (ASCII) from the Key
type box. If you are entering the long numeric password-use the
Hexedecimal option. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Quick Tip </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If you don't have a
password on your wireless network, leave the Key type and WEP key boxes
empty. <br>

</div>

<br>

If you are automatically assigned an IP address, use the Configuration
box to select DHCP. Otherwise, select Static IP Address, and enter the
details of your network in the boxes. <br>

<br>

<h2>I Need to Use WPA or I Use WPA-PSK on My Wireless Access
Point </h2>

To use WPA, you need a supported card. Such cards are listed on the WPA
Supplicant Web site at <a href="http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/">http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/</a>.
Common
drivers that support WPA include ipw2200, ipw2100, and madwifi. <br>

<br>

To use WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) with wireless cards in Ubuntu, the
wpasupplicant package must be installed. After installing it, edit
/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf. Networks are configured by adding network
blocks to the configuration file. Each network block can also be
assigned a priority so if both networks are seen, the higher priority
network is chosen. Examples for common network configurations can be
found in /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/examples/wpa_supplicant.conf.gz. <br>

<br>

Some configurations require certificates that should be available from
the network administrator. WPA Supplicant can also configure your
wireless card to use unencrypted networks, as noted in the example
file. After writing the file, edit /etc/default/wpasupplicant and
change the ENABLED, DRIVER, and INTERFACE options. The DRIVER option
should match the type of wireless device being used. Available drivers
can be viewed by typing: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$
wpa_supplicant -help </span><br>

<br>

To start the Supplicant run: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$
/etc/init.d/wpasupplicant start </span><br>

<br>

Lastly, wpasupplicant should be added to STOP_SERVICES in
/etc/default/acpi-support to ensure it functions properly after a
system suspend or hibernation. <br>

To check if the connection is working, run: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
wpa_cli </span><br>

<br>

This command gives information on the current connection along with
scrolling logs to indicate the current status. By default wpa_cli must
be run as root. Status will show what network the wireless card is
currently connected to and parameters about the link. Scan causes the
supplicant to look for a new access point while scan_results will
display what access points are locally accessible to the machine. As
soon as the supplicant authenticates ifplugd should start the interface
with ifup, and networking will be available shortly. If it seems that
the supplicant is not working it may be that a different driver must be
selected in the /etc/defaults/wpasupplicant configuration file. Also,
some cards can not operate in a mixed TKIP/CCMP (types of encryption)
mode. If it appears the PTK listed in the log from wpa_cli is CCMP but
that the GTK is TKIP, setting the pairwise and group entries of a
network configuration block to TKIP may fix the issue. <br>

<h1>Hardware </h1>

There are many, many different types of hardware available for
computers, including Web cams, network cards, hard disks, video cards,
sound cards, and more. For each of these devices to work, a driver
needs to be loaded by the Linux kernel. Unlike systems such as Windows,
you don't need to install a special driver that is included with the
device. Instead the driver should already be included in Ubuntu and
ready to work out of the box. <br>

<br>

Of course, this is not always the case, and sometimes hardware can be
something of a beast to get working. In this section we tear apart some
of the hardware related problems and attempt to resolve them. <br>

<h2>Ubuntu Has Not Detected My Old Sound Card. </h2>

Many older devices are not automatically detected by the current 2.6
kernel series. This is done to avoid hardware issues such as crashes.
Unfortunately if you have an older sound card, it means you need to
roll your sleeves up and poke around to get it running. To do this you
need to know which kernel module your card needs and then load the
module yourself. Loading the correct module for your device will not
cause your system to crash, but loading the wrong one may well do so.
You may need to experiment with different modules. <br>

<br>

Look for the model of sound card you have by referring to your
computer's specifications, the name of the device in Windows (if
applicable), or by opening the computer case and looking at the sound
chip. You can use Google to match a chip's serial number with the
chipset type. Here is a list of devices and the relevant kernel module
(taken from www.icewalkers.com/Linux/Howto/BootPrompt-HOWTO-8.html) <br>

<ul>

  <li>snd-es968 = ESS AudioDrive ES968 </li>

  <li>snd-sb16 = SoundBlaster 16 </li>

  <li>snd-sbawe = SoundBlaster 16 AWE </li>

  <li>snd-sb8 = Old 8 bit SoundBlaster (1.0, 2.0, Pro) </li>

  <li>snd-sgalaxy = Sound galaxy </li>

  <li>opl3sa2 = Yamaha OPL3-SA2/SA3 FM Synthesizer (on card chip)
  </li>

</ul>

When you have found the name of the module required, try loading it
into the kernel: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
modprobe themodule </span><br>

<br>

If there is no error message, it may just be the right one! Run
alsamixer to see if there is a sound device for it to configure: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ alsamixer
</span><br>

<br>

If the module is the wrong one, alsamixer will not allow you to set the
sound parameters. If you can, add the module name to the /etc/modules
file so that it gets loaded every time you boot: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
gedit /etc/modules </span><br>

<h2>My Cardbus Adapter is Not Being Recognized </h2>

If you have a cardbus adapter and are having difficulty getting it
work, open a terminal and run this command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst </span><br>

<br>

Find the line ## ## End Default Options ##&nbsp; below which you
can see your kernel. As an example: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">title&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ubuntu, kernel
2.6.12-10-686-smp &nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">root&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(hd0,0) </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">kernel&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.12-10-686-smp root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet
splash &nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">initrd&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;/boot/initrd.img-2.6.12-10-686-smp </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<br>

Add this to the end of the third line, one space after splash: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">pci=assign-busses </span><br>

<br>

It should now look like this: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">title&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ubuntu, kernel
2.6.12-10-686-smp &nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">root&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(hd0,0) </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">kernel&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.12-10-686-smp root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet
splash pci=assign-busses </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">initrd&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;/boot/initrd.img-2.6.12-10-686-smp </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<br>

Restart your computer, and your cardbus device should work. <br>

<h2>I Plug In My USB Stick and Nothing Happens </h2>

When a USB stick is plugged in, it must be mounted before you can
access it. This normally happens automatically, and you should see an
icon on your desktop similar to that displayed in Figure 6-8. <br>

<br>

<a href="6-8.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 438px; height: 256px;" alt="To use a USB storage device you just double-click the device icon that" src="6-8.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 6-8 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
To use a USB storage device you just double-click the device icon that
appears. </span><br>

<br>

Unfortunately, in some rare cases it doesn't work. To fix it, first
check that your system is set to automatically mount USB sticks. Click
System &gt; Preferences &gt; Removable Drives and Media and
look in the Storage tab. The following checkboxes should be selected: <br>

<ul>

  <li>Mount removable drives when hot-plugged </li>

  <li>Mount removable media when inserted </li>

  <li>Browse removable media when inserted </li>

</ul>

When you have selected the boxes, click Close, and try plugging your
USB stick in again. <br>

If you still have no luck, plug the USB stick in and then click
Places-Computer. If there is an additional drive in the Computer
window, right-click it, and select Mount Volume. <br>

<br>

If you still have no luck, you need to manually mount the disk. First,
click Applications &gt; Accessories &gt; Terminal, and then
plug in your USB stick. Now run the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt </span><br>

<br>

To view your files use the file manager to access the /mnt directory.
Before you finish with the disk, unmount it with: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ umount
/dev/sda1 </span><br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Drive Names </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">On some computers you may
need to use /dev/sdb1 or /dev/sdc1. Type in the following command when
you have plugged in your disk to see which drives are available:
foo@bar:~$ ls -l /dev/sd* <br>

</div>

<h2>I Copied Some Files to/from My USB Stick, but When I Access
It Later the Files Are Not There </h2>

When you plug in your USB stick, Ubuntu automatically mounts it. When
you copy files to or from the stick, the files are copied over in
bursts. Due to the way the kernel in Ubuntu works, sometimes there can
be a slight delay before your files copy. If you remove the USB stick
before they have finished copying some or all of the files may not have
copied over successfully. <br>

<br>

To ensure that everything you do with the USB stick is complete before
you remove it, you should unmount it. To do this right-click the drive
icon on your desktop or in Places &gt; Computer, and select
Unmount. Give it a few seconds. and when the light on the USB has
stopped flashing, you can safely remove it from your computer. <br>

<h2>My CD-ROM/DVD Is Not Working </h2>

If you are having problems accessing your CD-ROM/DVD drive, it is most
likely because it is not mounted. Click Places &gt; Computer and
look at the CD-ROM/DVD drive icon in the window. If the drive is not
mounted, the icon looks like a drive; otherwise it looks like a disc.
If the drive isn't mounted, right-click it, and click Mount Volume. <br>

<h2>My CD-ROM/DVD Drive Won't Eject </h2>

If you press the eject button on your CD-ROM drive and it won't eject,
click Places &gt; Computer, right-click the CD-ROM/DVD drive, and
select Eject. If this doesn't work, load up a terminal by clicking
Applications &gt; Accessories &gt; Terminal, and type: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ eject </span><br>

<h2>I Bought a Device, but It Doesn't Work In Ubuntu </h2>

When you buy a hardware device such as a graphics card, sound card, DVD
drive, or Webcam the device needs to have a driver installed for it to
work. In the Windows world this driver is included with the device, and
you simply install it after you have plugged the device in. <br>

<br>

In the Linux world things work a little differently. Your Ubuntu system
includes an important piece of software called the kernel that manages
how devices are used. The kernel includes a number of drivers that
cover a huge range of hardware out of the box. The philosophy in the
Linux world is that you should not even need to install a driver-just
install the hardware, and the kernel will pick it up. <br>

<br>

Although the kernel includes huge support for devices, there are
occasions when a driver is not included. At this point you should find
out if the device is actually supported in Ubuntu. To do this, search
the Ubuntu forums wiki and do a general search on the Internet for your
device and the keyword Linux. After a bit of hunting around you will
probably find a driver that is available but obviously was not included
with Ubuntu. Your first job should be to submit a bug report to say
that the driver is not included in Ubuntu (see "It was suggested I file
a Bug Report but I Don't Know How" later in this chapter). Include in
your bug report the address of the Web site with the driver. <br>

<h2>My Computer Says It Is Out of Memory </h2>

If you get memory errors and have a reasonable amount of memory (256MB
or more) and a swap partition, your memory may be faulty. To check if
your memory is working, restart your computer and when you see GRUB
loading, press Escape to display the boot menu. Select the memtest
option, and a small tool will check your memory for errors. <br>

<br>

The memtest utility tries its best to find problems with your memory,
but there may be cases where memtest passes but the memory still has
problems. To test against this, try swapping the memory with some that
is known to work and see if the problems go away. If they do, the
memory is certainly faulty. <br>

How Can I Copy Photos from My Mobile Phone to My Ubuntu Computer with
Bluetooth? <br>

Ubuntu has built in Bluetooth support, but you need to install the
GNOME-Bluetooth package. Inside this package is a small tool called
GNOME-obex-server. This application allows you to transfer files from
your mobile to your computer. <br>

<br>

When you have installed the package, hit Alt+F2, and enter
GNOME-obex-server. A small blue icon appears in the notification area,
and you can now send a file from your phone via Bluetooth. &nbsp;<br>

<h2>I Can Read My USB Storage Device, but I can't Write to It </h2>

If you are having trouble writing to a USB key or external USB hard
drive, there are a number of possible causes of the problem. <br>

<br>

The first and most simple to diagnose is that you may not have
permission to write to the device. When you plug in the drive,
right-click the icon that appears on your desktop, and select
Properties. In the window that appears, click the Permissions tab and
ensure that the Others line has the Write checkbox selected. If this is
not selected, you don't have permission to access the drive. &nbsp;<br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Quick Tip </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If you do have sufficient
permissions but still can't write to the drive, jump to the "Filesystem
Fun" section below. <br>

</div>

<br>

To change these permissions, fire up a terminal, and move to the /media
folder: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ cd /media
</span><br>

<br>

Now take a look at which drives are in there: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ ls -al </span><br>

<br>

In the output that appears you should see "usbdisk" as one of the
entries. Now change the permissions so everyone can access it: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
chmod a+w usbdisk </span><br>

<br>

You should now be able to access the disk. <br>

<h3>Filesystem Fun </h3>

If you have permissions to access the drive but still can't write to
it, the problem is likely to be a filesystem issue. On a storage device
such as a floppy disk, USB key, or hard drive, a specific type of
filesystem is used to manage how the files are written to the physical
disk. Ordinarily, you don't need to worry about this. But when things
go wrong, its time to figure out the details. <br>

<br>

There are a number of different filesystems. The default Linux
filesystem is ext3. In the Windows world, a few other filesystems are
available such as FAT16, FAT32, and the NTFS system used by Windows NT.
<br>

Although FAT16 and FAT32 are fully supported in Ubuntu, an NTFS
filesystem cannot yet be written to on a Linux computer. However,
recent new code has gone in the Linux kernel to write to NTFS with FUSE
or a kernel module. This code is still rather experimental and not
included in a stock Ubuntu system, so be careful when playing with it. <br>

<br>

To find out which filesystem the device uses, run the following
command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
mount </span><br>

<br>

In the output, look for the /dev/sda1 or /dev/sdb1 line. USB devices
are usually located at either of these locations. You can see the
filesystem next to where is says type. As an example take the
following: <br>

/dev/sda1 on /media/usbdisk type ext3 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev) <br>

In this example, the filesystem is ext3. You can also add the
umask=0000 option if you want to allow any user to read the disk. <br>

<br>

If the file system is supported (ext3, VFAT, FAT16, FAT32) but you
still can't access the disk, the filesystem may be corrupted. In cases
such as this it makes sense to format the disk with a new filesystem. <br>

Before you format your disk, make absolutely sure that you are happy to
remove the entire contents of the disk. If you need the files on the
disk, have a look around the Internet and post to the Ubuntu Forums to
see if anyone else can help you before you format the disk. Formatting
really is the last option you have available! <br>

<h2>How Do I Format a Disk? </h2>

When most people think of formatting a disk, they think it is the
process of deleting everything on the disk. Formatting a disk actually
involves a little bit more, and it completely replaces the filesystem
on the disk. <br>

A side benefit to formatting a disk is making the disk work on
different computers. Only certain types of filesystems are supported by
each OS, and formatting a disk with a common filesystem can ensure that
it works with these different OS. As an example, if you format a USB
key with the ext3 filesystem, it won't work in Windows. If you use the
VFAT filesystem, it will work in both Windows and Linux. <br>

<br>

Formatting is fairly simple, and you just need to know the location of
the device. USB storage devices (such as USB key rings and key fobs)
tend to be located at /dev/sda1 or /dev/sdb1. Make sure that you have
the right device, and then use one of the many mkfs commands to create
the relevant filesystem. As an example, to create an ext3 filesystem,
use the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda1 </span><br>

<br>

There are a range of other mkfs commands that can be used to create
other filesystems: <br>

<ul>

  <li>mkfs </li>

  <li>mkfs.cramfs </li>

  <li>mkfs.ext2 </li>

  <li>mkfs.ext3 </li>

  <li>mkfs.jfs&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

  <li>mkfs.minix&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

  <li>mkfs.msdos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

  <li>mkfs.reiser4&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

  <li>mkfs.reiserfs </li>

  <li>mkfs.vfat </li>

  <li>mkfs.xfs </li>

</ul>

Each of these commands is used in the same way. <br>

<h2>The Keys On My Keyboard Spit Out the Wrong Letters/Symbols </h2>

Every keyboard on a computer has a particular keyboard layout and
locale attached to it. The keyboard layout specifies how many keyboard
keys you have, in what order, and the locale specifies what each key
does. <br>

The locale is particularly important as letters and symbols vary
dramatically in different locales. Aside from different types of
letters, common symbols are often placed in different areas. As an
example, on some keyboards the double quote (") is on the key above the
right shift key. On some keyboards it is Shift+2. Having the wrong
keyboard settings can be incredibly frustrating, and if the symbols
printed on your keys don't match up to the symbol spat out when you
press it, your keyboard settings are incorrect. <br>

<br>

To fix this click System &gt; Preferences &gt; Keyboard. Click
the Layouts tab, and next to the Keyboard model box click the ...
button to select your keyboard model if you know it. If you don't know
it, use the default setting. Now click the Add button, and resize the
window so you can see the keyboard layout diagram more easily. Choose a
different locale that matches your keyboard, and then click OK. <br>

<br>

Now click on the Keyboard tab, and use the 'Type to test settings' box
to test if your keyboard settings are correct. <br>

<h2>My Serial Mouse Is Not Working </h2>

To get a nonUSB serial mouse working, first run this command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg </span><br>

<br>

When asked for the mouse device, select /dev/ttys0 for COM1 or
/dev/ttys1 for COM2. <br>

<h2>My Mouse Scroll Wheel Does Not Work </h2>

To enable your scroll wheel, you need to run the X configuration
program: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg </span><br>

<br>

One of the questions asks if you would like to enable the scroll wheel.
Enable this, and then restart your desktop. Your lovely little scroll
wheel should work now. <br>

<br>

<h2>My Remote Control Doesn't Work </h2>

If you want to use a remote control with your Ubuntu computer, you need
to install the Linux Infra Red Control (LIRC) package in Synaptic. LIRC
is the library, and it supports a wide range of remote control units. <br>

<br>

The first step is to determine which LIRC driver is required for your
particular remote control. Take a look at the list of remotes on the
LIRC site at www.lirc.org/ or use your favorite search engine if it is
not listed on the site. <br>

LIRC includes a number of built in drivers, and you can see which ones
are included by running the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ lircd
-driver=help </span><br>

<br>

When you know which driver is required and you know your installed LIRC
supports, you can edit the hardware.conf file in the /etc/lirc file to
configure which one is used. Simply set the DRIVER line to the driver
you selected. With this complete, restart LIRC: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$
/etc/init.d/lirc restart </span><br>

<br>

With LIRC ready and running, you can test it by running the following
command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$
/etc/init.d/lirc restart </span><br>

<br>

When you press the buttons on your remote control, a code should
appear. This code can be mapped to a button on your remote by editing
the lircd.conf file in /etc/lirc. For specific configuration details,
see the LIRC Web site. <br>

<h2>How Do I Find Out Which Hardware Works In Ubuntu Before I
Purchase It? </h2>

Currently, there is no centralized device database to search for
hardware that works with Ubuntu, although work is going on to support
this in a future version of Ubuntu. <br>

<br>

A good place to start is to look at
<a href="https://wiki.Ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport">https://wiki.Ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport</a>.
You should then search the
discussion forums and use Google to find out if anyone else has used
it. Although not an ideal way of digging out the information, the
forums and Google are likely to give you the information you need until
the full device database is complete. <br>

<h1>System Administration </h1>

Traditionally, Linux has been very popular with system administrators.
This has not only been due to Linux's incredible flexibility and power,
but also the UNIX philosophy that drives much of the Linux platform.
System administrators spend much of their day in the command line
crafting strings of commands that hook together to do something
interesting. With this powerful underlying command line platform, so
much is possible. <br>

<br>

System administration is sometimes fraught with its own fair share of
problems though. This section lines up some of the problems and
attempts to resolve them. <br>

<h2>How Do I Schedule Things to Happen? </h2>

Built right into Ubuntu is a very powerful system to schedule things to
happen at specific times or at regular intervals. This system, called
cron, allows you to specify the timing details and the command to run
in a special file called a crontab. <br>

<br>

The crontab is a simple text file that holds a list of commands that
are to be run at specified times. These commands, and their related run
times, are controlled by the cron daemon and are executed in the
system's background. More information can be found by viewing the
crontab's man page, and we will run through a simple crontab example
later to demonstrate how it is used. <br>

<br>

The system maintains a crontab for each user on the system. In order to
edit or create a crontab, you need to load it into a text editor. This
text editor is opened when you use the -e option on the crontab
command. To create a crontab open a terminal and run the following
command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ crontab
-e </span><br>

<br>

The default nano text editor will&nbsp; open an empty file crontab
file. When adding crontab instructions, each line represents a separate
crontab entry, also known as a cron job. <br>

<h3>Crontab Sections </h3>

A typical line in a crontab looks like this: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">00&nbsp;
1&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; ps ax </span><br>

<br>

Each of the sections is separated by a space, with the final section
having one or more spaces in it. No spaces are allowed within Sections
1-5, only between them. Sections 1-5 are used to indicate when and how
often you want the task to be executed. This is how a cron job is laid
out from the left to right: <br>

<ul>

  <li>minute: (0-59) </li>

  <li>hour: (0-23, 0&nbsp; = midnight) </li>

  <li>day: (1-31) </li>

  <li>month: (1-12) </li>

  <li>weekday: (0-6, 0&nbsp; = Sunday) </li>

  <li>command: Code </li>

</ul>

If you read each line in the crontab from the left and use the above
column descriptions, you can see how the instruction is built up. As an
example: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">01 04 1 1 1
/usr/bin/somedirectory/somecommand </span><br>

<br>

The above example runs /usr/bin/somedirectory/somecommand at 4:01 a.m.
on any Monday, which falls on January 1. An asterisk (*) can be used so
that every instance (every hour, every weekday, every month, etc.) of a
time period is used. Code: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">01 04 * * *
/usr/bin/somedirectory/somecommand </span><br>

<br>

The above example will run /usr/bin/somedirectory/somecommand at 4:01am
on every day of every month. <br>

Comma-separated values can be used to run more than one instance of a
particular command within a time period. Dash-separated values can be
used to run a command continuously: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">01,31 04,05 1-15 1,6
* /usr/bin/somedirectory/somecommand </span><br>

<br>

The above example will run /usr/bin/somedirectory/somecommand at 01 and
31 past the hours of 4:00am and 5:00am on the 1st through the 15th of
every January and June. <br>

<br>

The /usr/bin/somedirectory/somecommand text in the above examples
indicates the task which will be run at the specified times. It is
recommended that you use the full path to the desired commands as shown
in the above examples. The crontab will begin running as soon as it is
properly edited and saved. <br>

<h3>Crontab Command Options </h3>

There are a number of options you can pass to the crontab command to
make it do different things. Here are some common options: <br>

<ul>

  <li>The -l option causes the current crontab to be displayed on
standard output. </li>

  <li>The -r option causes the current crontab to be removed. </li>

  <li>The -e option is used to edit the current crontab using the
editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables. </li>

</ul>

When you edit a crontab file, the modified crontab is checked for
accuracy and, if there are no errors, installed automatically. <br>

<h3>An Example </h3>

Below is an example of how to set up a crontab to run updatedb, which
updates the slocate database: Open konsole and type crontab -e and
press enter, type the following line, substituting the full path for
the one shown below, into the editor: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">45 04 * * *
/usr/bin/updatedb </span><br>

<br>

Save your changes, and exit the editor. Crontab will let you know if
you made any mistakes. The crontab will be installed and begin running
if there are no errors. That's it. You now have a cron job setup to run
updatedb, which updates the slocate database, every morning at 4:45. <br>

<br>

Note that a semicolon (;) or the double-ampersand (&amp;&amp;)
can also be used in the command section to run multiple commands
consecutively: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">45 04 * * *
/usr/sbin/chkrootkit &amp;&amp; /usr/bin/updatedb </span><br>

<br>

The semicolon will cause both commands to be executed. The double
ampersand will cause the second command to execute only if the first
command does not fail. The above example will run chkrootkit and
updatedb at 4:45am daily, providing you have all listed applications
installed. <br>

<h2>How Can I Copy a File from One Computer to Another? </h2>

The easiest way to copy files between machines is to use the Places
&gt; Connect to Server dialog box to make a connection using the
graphical file manager. If you would prefer to do this on the command
line, use the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ scp
file.txt jimmy@chin.com:/home/jimmy </span><br>

<br>

The scp command works the same as the normal cp command, but it copies
the file (file.txt) to another server (chin.com) using a specific user
account (jimmy) and into a particular directory on the remote computer
(/home/jimmy). <br>

<h2>I Know an Application Is Available In Ubuntu but Synaptic
Can't Find It </h2>

If you are browsing through Synaptic and can't find a package that you
know is available for Ubuntu, it is likely that you have not enabled
the additional repositories. <br>

<br>

To fix this load Synaptic and click Settings &gt; Repositories.
Click the Add button, and select the Community and Nonfree checkboxes.
Click OK to accept the settings and then OK on the Repositories window.
Finally, click the Reload button to fresh the package list. Your
package should now be listed. <br>

<h2>I Am Running Ubuntu on an Older Computer, and I Would Like a
Faster Desktop </h2>

Unlike other OS, Linux has the flexibility to scale incredibly well
across different computers with different levels of horsepower. With
the huge range of Open Source available, you can tweak your system so
that it can be optimized in lots of different areas. This is
particularly useful for recycling PCs. A number of large organizations
will throw out older hardware that is unable to run the latest OS from
Microsoft. In many cases, these computers are actually perfectly usable
if the software is optimized a little. Some Open Source groups have set
up to take these old machines, install Linux, and provide them to their
local communities. <br>

<br>

The first aspect to optimize is the GUI. The default desktop in Ubuntu
uses GNOME, and GNOME requires a reasonable degree of processing power.
If you don't need many of the features in GNOME and literally just want
to start applications, using something such as ICEWM may be a better
choice. Load Synaptic, and ensure the Community repository is enabled.
Install the icewm and menu packages. Now log out, and before you log
back in, click the Options menu to change your session from the default
one to the icewm one. A number of alternative desktop environments are
available. For more functionality than icewm, try installing the
xubuntu-desktop package and running the xfce session, also seen in
Xubuntu (Fig 6-9). <br>

<br>

You may also want to explore applications that are more lightweight. As
an example, instead of using OpenOffice.org for word processing, try
Abiword. It is a featureful but lightweight word processor. Try the
following alternatives: <br>

<ul>

  <li>Web Browser: Instead of Firefox, use Galeon. </li>

  <li>Terminal: Use an xterm instead of the GNOME Terminal. </li>

  <li>Spreadsheet:&nbsp; An alternative to OpenOffice.org for
spreadsheets is Gnumeric. </li>

</ul>

<a href="6-9.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 375px; height: 375px;" alt="Also look at the XUbuntu distribution, which includes the lightweight" src="6-9.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 6-9 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Also look at the XUbuntu distribution, which includes the lightweight
Xfce4 instead of GNOME. </span><br>

<h2>I Have Reinstalled Windows, and Now Ubuntu Won't Start! </h2>

The first thing your computer does when you turn it on is read a
special place on your hard disk called the master boot record (MBR).
The information written there tells the computer what to do next. When
you installed Ubuntu, it placed a boot menu on the MBR that lets you
choose from which system to boot. &nbsp;<br>

<br>

Unfortunately, when you reinstall Windows it will recreate the MBR, not
taking into consideration that any other OS may exist and replacing it
with an MBR that only boots Windows. This is no good, and you naturally
want to be able to replace it with the menu that lets you choose which
system to boot. <br>

<br>

Grab the CD you used to install Ubuntu on your computer. If you don't
have it anymore, download a CD image from www.Ubuntu.com/download, and
burn it on a blank CD. If you used the live CD to install, you will
need to use the alternative installation CD with the traditional text
mode installer. <br>

<br>

Insert the CD in the drive, and restart your computer. It will boot on
the CD instead of using the hard disk as usual. Now highlight the
Rescue a Broken System line, and press Enter. Select your language and
keyboard, and let the installer detect the network (for the computer
name, you can leave the default Ubuntu) just like when you installed
Ubuntu for the first time. <br>

<br>

You will then be presented with a list of available partitions on your
hard disks. Don't worry about the first line (/dev/discs/disc0/part1).
Start looking at the other lines. You need to remember on which disk
and on which partition Ubuntu is installed. Most of the time, you
probably have just one disk. If you have Windows installed on it, it is
probably located on the first partition of this disk, and Ubuntu should
be on the second one. Therefore, you probably want to select
/dev/discs/disc1/part2 (then press Enter), unless your situation is
more complex. <br>

<br>

On the last screen, select the first line Execute a shell in .... You
can now enter commands. Start by mounting the disks on your system: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~# mount -a </span><br>

<br>

Now type: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~#&nbsp;df
</span><br>

<br>

Look at the list printed on the screen. Search the last column for the
single / character, and on the corresponding line look for the first
column. It should say something such as /dev/hda2 (the last few
characters may be different for you). Now type the following command,
and replace /dev/hda with what you have just read, but without the last
digit (/dev/hda instead of /dev/hda2 in the above example): <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~#&nbsp;grub-install
/dev/hda </span><br>

<br>

Wait for the process to finish. It might take a few minutes. About a
dozen lines should have appeared on the screen. Check whether you find
the text 'installation finished'. If you do, everything went fine. You
can now restart your computer by typing <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~#&nbsp;exit
</span><br>

<br>

Eject the CD, and then select Reboot the System. Welcome back to
Ubuntu! <br>

<h2>How Do I Fix My Disk After a Power Failure? </h2>

Although the Ubuntu development team takes every care to ensure every
possible situation is catered for, one of the most difficult problems
are power cuts. Computers rely on power, and when it is dramatically
removed from the system, the whole Ubuntu world in your computer shuts
down immediately. The problem with this is that sudden power failure
causes your Ubuntu machine to shut down improperly. When you next start
the computer you may then be prompted with a confusing fsck message.
What is this and how do we fix it? <br>

<br>

The fsck program is a little tool to fix hard disks that don't have
consistent filesystems; filesystems typically made inconsistent by
power failures. When the disk is inconsistent, Ubuntu automatically
runs fsck to fix it. It asks you a bunch of questions that only a
filesystem developer really understands, and you feel obliged to say
Yes to each of them. As such, you sit there hammering the Y key over
and over answering the questions. <br>

<br>

There is a quick and simple fix to this problem. Instead of wearing out
your Y key, you can simply edit one file and have any errors
automatically fixed for you. <br>

<br>

If your system is already running the desktop, open a terminal. and
enter the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
gedit /etc/default/rcS </span><br>

<br>

Now change the FSCKFIX line to the following: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">FSCKFIX=yes </span><br>

<br>

Save the file, and the next time you reboot fsck will fix any detected
disk problems without you having to intervene. <br>

<br>

If you are using the character based login, use the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo nano
/etc/default/rcS </span><br>

<br>

Change the FSCKFIX line as above and then press Ctrl-O and Ctrl-X to
save and exit. <br>

<h2>Ubuntu Takes Up Too Much Disk Space on My Old Computer </h2>

If you are running Ubuntu on an older computer with a limited amount of
disk space, you may want to choose software with more limited space
requirements. Luckily, Ubuntu is incredibly flexible in choosing which
software you want to install. <br>

<br>

Install Ubuntu from the alternative installation disk (not the live
CD). When you have booted the installer, choose Install a Server, and
install Ubuntu as usual. When you have rebooted into your minimal
install, log in and type: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo nano
/etc/apt/sources.list </span><br>

<br>

Press the down cursor until you reach the line <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;"># deb
http://archive.Ubuntu.com/Ubuntu/ dapper universe main restricted
multiverse </span><br>

<br>

Press the X key twice to delete the # symbol at the beginning of that
line. Save the file by typing :wq, and then hit Enter. Here you have
enabled a repository. If you have enabled repositories in the past in
Synaptic, this is what happens behind the scenes. You can manage you
repositories by simply editing /etc/apt/source.list. <br>

<br>

Now run the following commands: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
apt-get update </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
apt-get install x-window-system-core xterm wdm icewm menu </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<br>

This whole system can be installed on a disk with less than 1G of free
space. <br>

My Computer Is Running Quite Slowly-How Can I Find Out What Is Going
On? <br>

If you are having performance problems, there may be a particular
process on your computer gobbling up all of the memory. To find out
what is happening, run the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ top </span><br>

<br>

The top command shows the current processes on your computer that are
using the most system resources. If you see a particular program taking
up an unusual amount of resources, that may be the culprit. <br>

Some processes (such as the Apache Webserver) fork and replicate
themselves when used. Another useful technique is to see how many of
these processes are running: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ ps ax |
grep theprogram | wc -l </span><br>

<br>

This command takes a listing of the processes running on the system,
uses grep to search for a specific process and then counts the number
of lines returned, thus indicating how many processes are running. <br>

<h2>How Can I Find Out the Different Options for Commands? </h2>

Every command that is included in Ubuntu has a small reference card
called a man page included. This page displays the range of options
that are available. Access it by typing man, and then enter the
command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ man grep </span><br>

<br>

Another method of listing the options is to use the -h or -help
options: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ grep
-help </span><br>

<h2>How Do I Get My Root Account Back? </h2>

In a default Ubuntu installation, the root account is disabled. Instead
the user account that is created in the installation process is used
with sudo to access administer facilities. The sudo command is used
extensively to temporarily take on root privileges when needed. <br>

<br>

If you want to get the root account back, run the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
passwd root </span><br>

<br>

Now enter your user account's password and then enter a new root
password. You will be asked to verify the new root password. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Tired of Typing Sudo? </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If you want to type in a
number of root commands and don't want to constantly prefix every
command with sudo, run the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ su - </span><br>

<br>

This will upgrade your terminal to the root user. You can also use the
-i switch in sudo: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo -i </span><br>

<br>

Everything you type in now is as the root user. To go back to your
original user, use the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~# exit </span><br>

<br>

When using this command, note how when you are a normal user the prompt
ends with a $ symbol, but when root it ends with a # symbol. &nbsp;<br>

</div>

<br>

To disable the root account at a later date, run the following command:
<br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
passwd -l root </span><br>

<br>

This will lock the root account. <br>

<h2>I Forgot My System Password-What Can I Do? </h2>

Although passwords are indefinably essential and useful, they are also
prone to being forgotten. With an increasing number of nasties out
there on the Internet wanting to suck your password away, you need to
think of more complex passwords, which are in turn harder to remember
and easier to forget. <br>

<br>

If you forget the system password, you need to jump through a few more
hoops to reset your password. Reset your computer and when you see the
word GRUB appear on the screen, press Escape to see the boot menu.
Select the recovery mode option from the menu. When the computer boots
it will present you with a root shell. At the prompt type: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~# passwd
&lt;username&gt; </span><br>

<br>

Follow the prompts to set a new password. Finally, reboot the computer
with the following command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~#&nbsp;reboot
</span><br>

<h2>How Do I Access My Windows Partitions? </h2>

If you are running Ubuntu on a computer with a Windows disk, you may
want to read and write to the disk. Ubuntu can safely read the Windows
NT NTFS partitions and can read and write to Windows 95/98/2000 FAT32
partitions. <br>

<br>

First, load a terminal, and use the fdisk command to know what
partitions you currently have: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
fdisk -l </span><br>

<br>

The output should be similar to this: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">Disk /dev/hda: 81.9

In this output, the /dev/hda1 partition (the first partition on the
first disk) is a 10GB Windows NTFS partition (probably called C:) and
/dev/hda5 is a 2GB FAT32 partition (probably called D:) <br>

<br>

When you access a disk, you need to mount it first. To mount it, you
need to indicate a directory where the files from the disk are
accessed-this is called a mount point. Create mount points in /media
for the Windows partitions. It is good to use /media/C for C: and
/media/D for D:, etc. to make things easy to remember. &nbsp;<br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
mkdir /media/C /media/D </span><br>

<br>

To make the disks accessible when you boot the computer, you need to
add a few lines to /etc/fstab. This file indicates which disks are
available. Add the following two lines: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">/dev/hda1&nbsp;&nbsp;
/media/C&nbsp;&nbsp; ntfs&nbsp;
nls=utf8,umask=0222&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 0 </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">/dev/hda5&nbsp;&nbsp;
/media/D&nbsp;&nbsp; vfat&nbsp;
defaults,umask=0000&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 0 </span><br>

<br>

The fourth column lets you specify options for mounting the partition,
and nls=utf8,umask=0222 means that any user can read the NTFS
partition. <br>

<br>

To mount the two partitions without restarting, run the following
command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
mount -a </span><br>

<br>

The two partitions are now available and will be automatically mounted
the next time Ubuntu is restarted. <br>

<h2>Ubuntu Is Slow On My AMD K7 Computer </h2>

The computer world is filled with different processors, including but
not limited to Intel, AMD, Cyrix, Transmeta, Arm, Sun, and IBM
processors. Although Linux supports each of these processors, the Linux
kernel can often be optimized for specific processors. <br>

<br>

First, load Synaptic. Click the Search button, and type in k7. Find and
install the Linux-k7 package. Close Synaptic, and restart the computer.
Hit Escape when you see GRUB appear to display the boot menu. Select
the k7 kernel, and it will use the new kernel. Your system will work
exactly the same as before, but be that little bit quicker. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">And for Intel </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">You can also install a
Linux-686 kernel for Pentium class computers. <br>

<h2>How Do I Add Users? </h2>

To add a new user to your computer select System &gt;
Administration &gt; Users and Groups. When the window loads, click
the Add User button, and then just fill in the details. To do this in
the command line, use the adduser command: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ sudo
adduser jimmy </span><br>

<br>

This adds a user called Jimmy. <br>

And now, we'll finish with a collection of other common problems and
quirks that don't fit neatly into any of the other categories in this
chapter. <br>

<h2>Running Another OS In Ubuntu </h2>

Some of you will have read the title of this recipe and wondered how on
earth you can run another OS on an existing OS. Surely such a thing is
not possible? Well, actually it is. &nbsp;<br>

<br>

In recent years virtualization technology has been developed to
simulate a computer in software. You can use this technology to boot a
virtual computer in a window and run an OS on it, entirely in software.
There have been some commercial applications to do this for a while,
but recently the Open Source QEMU project has developed to such a point
to make this viable to run a variety of different OS. It can run
Windows, FreeBSD, Netware, and even other Ubuntu installations. <br>

<br>

First of all, use Synaptic to install QEMU. When it has installed, use
the file manager to create a folder in your home directory called
"qemu." Now load a terminal and run the following commands: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ cd qemu </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~qemu$
qemu-img create hd.img 350M </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<br>

The last parameter (350M) indicates the size of the virtual drive in
megabytes. Feel free to adjust this to your liking. <br>

<br>

The next step is to boot an install CD in the virtual machine: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ qemu
-boot d -cdrom /dev/cdrom -hda hd.img </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<br>

When your installation has finished, reboot the virtual machine: <br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">foo@bar:~$ qemu
-boot c -fda /dev/fda -cdrom /dev/cdrom -hda hd.img -user-net -pci -m
256 -k en </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<br>

With the setup complete, you can add a link to the new OS on your
panel. Right-click on the panel where you want to create the launcher,
and choose Add to Panel &gt; Custom Application Launcher. Enter the
following details: <br>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Name: Win2000 <br>

Command: qemu -boot c -fda /dev/fda -cdrom /dev/cdrom -hda
/path/to/your/hd.img -user-net -pci -m 256 -k en <br>

</div>

<br>

Choose an icon for your new OS. <br>

<h2>It Was Suggested I File a Bug Report, but I Don't Know How </h2>

Ubuntu is a collaboratively developed system in which hundreds of
developers from around the world work together to build a simple yet
powerful distribution. With so much software involved in Ubuntu, bugs
and problems can naturally creep into the system. If you believe that
the problem you have is not a configuration or hardware error, it may
well be a bug. Anyone can submit a bug, and it is encouraged that
regular users of Ubuntu contribute bug reports where possible. <br>

<br>

Bug reports are handled on a special Web site called Launchpad, which
resides at <a href="http://launchpad.net/">http://launchpad.net/</a>
(see Figure 6-10). <br>

<br>

<a href="6-10.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 882px; height: 611px;" alt="Launchpad is where the bug reports live." src="6-10.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 6-10 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Launchpad is where the bug reports live. </span><br>

<br>

Launchpad provides a complete environment in which bugs can be tracked
and future features are merged into Ubuntu. Launchpad is not only
designed to make bugs for Ubuntu easy to report, but to also support
bugs for other systems too. This means that developers can work
together to resolve problems. <br>

<br>

To report a bug, click on the Help menu in the application for which
you want to report the bug. Select Get Online Help. Firefox will now
load, and you are taken to the Launchpad site. To use Launchpad, you
need a user account, so click the Register link to register your
account. Enter your e-mail address, and you will be e-mailed
registration details. When you have completed the registration, log in
to Launchpad. You can always access your application in Launchpad by
using the Get Online Help menu item. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Another Way Into the Bug
Tracking System </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">You can also access the
bug tracking system by going to Launchpad, clicking the Bugs link in
the right sidebar, and then entering the name of the application in the
text box farther down the page. If possible, it is generally
recommended that you use the Help menu approach as it will
automatically pick the right application for you. <br>

</div>

<br>

The first step is to check if the bug has already been reported. In the
right sidebar of Launchpad are a series of menu options. Each bug that
is added to the system is automatically given a unique ID for the bug,
and you can search for this number if needed. You can alternatively
search for something related to the problem. As an example, search for
"crash" or "hang." If you find your bug has already been reported, you
can keep updated with changes to do with the bug by clicking the
Subscribe link in the right sidebar. <br>

<br>

If no bug exists, you should report it yourself. To do this, click the
Report a Bug in &lt;application name&gt; in Ubuntu link. Simply
fill in the Summary box with a single line description of the bug, and
then use the Description box to fill in the details. You should be as
detailed as possible and include your computer's specifications, any
special steps you went through to trigger the bug, the effects of the
bug, and how you expected the software to work. Try to be detailed, but
keep everything you say relevant to the bug. If you would prefer to
keep your bug report confidential, select the checkbox, but it is
highly recommended you keep your bug reports public if possible. This
means that as many people as possible can see the report and possibly
act on it. <br>

<br>

With the bug submitted, you will receive e-mail updates about the
progress the developers are making to fix the bug. In some cases the
developers may ask you to run commands or try different things to help
nail down the bug so they can fix it. <br>

<br>

Bug reporting is an essential process in which everyday users of Ubuntu
can really help keep the software as bug-free and stable as possible.
It is a truly valid contribution to the Open Source community. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Need a Hand? </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If you need help reporting
a bug, ask for support on the Ubuntu-users list, IRC, or the forums.
The community will be more than happy to help. <br>

<h2>How Can I Monitor the Weather? </h2>

Besides looking out the window, you can add a weather applet to a panel
that shows the current temperature along with an icon that indicates
sunshine or rain. Right-click a panel, and select Add to Panel. Drag
the weather applet (under Accessories) to an empty spot on the panel,
and click Close. Now right-click the weather applet, select
Preferences, and select the Location tab. From here you can select your
city or a city in the vicinity. Click Close when you are done. If you
want more detailed information, just click the applet. <br>

<h2>How Do I Make Ubuntu Bread? </h2>

With so many recipes in this chapter to solve common problems or
perform small tweaks and optimizations, it seems unfair not to include
an actual recipe. This actual recipe was posted to the popular Ubuntu
Forums to create some special Ukranian egg bread called Kalach, which
is much- like challah or any other egg bread. The twist of course is
that it is shaped like our favorite distribution's logo (see Figure
6-11). <br>

<br>

<a href="6-11.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="Launchpad is where the bug reports live." src="6-11.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 6-11 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
The Ubuntu loaf </span><br>

<br>

To create this bread you will need the following ingredients: <br>

<ul>

  <li>3 eggs </li>

  <li>1 teaspoon of yeast </li>

  <li>3/4 cup warm water (40 degrees Celsius - see above) </li>

  <li>pinch of salt </li>

  <li>1/4 cup oil </li>

  <li>1/4 cup sugar </li>

  <li>3 to 5 cups flour </li>

</ul>

First put the yeast in the warm water while you gather the other
ingredients. <br>

<br>

Beat the three eggs in a bowl and save a teaspoon of the egg mixture
for later. Add three cups of flour to a big bowl along with the egg,
sugar, oil, and salt. When the yeast is bubbly, add it in too. Knead.
If it is crumbly, add water. If it is too sticky, add more flour. The
dough should be firmer than your average bread dough to keep its shape.
<br>

<br>

Cover the bowl with a damp towel, and let the dough rise in a warm
place. When it has doubled in size, punch it down, and roll it out into
three ropes. <br>

<br>

Make the ropes less than one inch thick (2.5cm) so that it will cook
evenly. Do this on a large surface. You need a lot of room. Use a bit
of oil if things are sticky. Your dough should be somewhat stiff, so
this should not be a problem. <br>

<br>

You should end up with three ropes that are a little less than three
feet long (75 cm). Pinch them together on one end and then braid them. <br>

<br>

Take the lowermost rope and place it in between the other two. The
middle rope is now the lowest rope, move it into position by bringing
it down to where the other rope (lowermost) used to be. Take the
topmost rope and place it in between the other two. Take the rope that
is now highest and pull it up to it's position as topmost rope. Place
the lowermost rope in between the two others. You get the picture... <br>

<br>

When you have a long braid, snip off the ends, and join the ends to
form a circle. Try to join the individual ropes together as best as you
can. Place it on an oiled cookie sheet. Take the snipped off bits and
form two long strands. Intertwine them together by putting them
side-by-side and holding one end while rolling the other end with the
palm of your hand. Stretch this out around the bottom of the big braid
and join the ends together. <br>

Cover the kalach with a damp towel and let it double in size (about an
hour, maybe less, on a hot day). Brush it with the egg mixture. You
should have enough to cover it completely. Cook at 350&deg;
Fahrenheit until it becomes dark brown. Let it cool. <br>

<br>

Be very careful. My dog jumps up on the table to eat this. I make this
for special occasions, and it is embarrassing when guests find the dog
with the half of the bread that she could not finish under the table. <br>

<h2>How Can I Prevent the Pain I am Getting My Fingers When I
Type? </h2>

If you feel pain or numbness in your fingers, you are likely suffering
from Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). This common complaint typically
afflicts those who work with computers for long periods every day. The
constant movement of the fingers in such a repetitive fashion can cause
swelling and pain in the fingers and wrists. RSI can also affect your
neck, back, legs, and other areas. <br>

<br>

If you suspect you have RSI you should first consult your doctor. RSI
is a condition that requires treatment. This treatment can come in the
form of physiotherapy, regular breaks, workspace adjustments, and in
some extreme cases, medication or surgery. <br>

<br>

One of the most common methods of reducing RSI is to take regular rest
breaks. It is a good idea to break about once an hour. Your desktop can
help with this. Click on System &gt; Preferences &gt; Keyboard,
and select the Typing Break tab. You can use the settings in the tab to
enforce a break once an hour. <br>

<br>

Another type of break is a micropause. These breaks usually occur every
couple of minutes, and the break lasts for only a few seconds. These
breaks are intended to be less intrusive and give your hands a chance
to regularly rest for a short period to allow the blood to flow. A
useful little tool called Workrave has been developed to enforce
regular micropauses. Use the Synaptic package manager to install
Workrave. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Remember! </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Always consult a doctor
with any health problems. RSI in many cases is a treatable problem, but
your doctor can best advise you on the recommended treatment. <br>

<h1>Summary </h1>

Software by its very nature is subject to inaccuracies, bugs, and
usability problems-and users by their very nature are subject to
errors, mistakes, and misjudgments. Although every release of Ubuntu
makes Linux and computing far easier to use and more flexible than the
previous release, there are always going to be occasions when something
just doesn't work. <br>

<br>

Hopefully, this chapter has provided some useful solutions to some of
the typical problems you may face when using Ubuntu. If this chapter
still does not answer you questions though, head over to the incredible
Ubuntu Forums at www.Ubuntuforums.org/ to tap into a huge community of
people, who can help.
