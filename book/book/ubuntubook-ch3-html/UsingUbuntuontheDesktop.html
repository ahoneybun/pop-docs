<br>

With Ubuntu installed and ready to rock, its time to get started using
your new desktop. The stock install of Ubuntu provides a very complete
and flexible system. Unlike other operating systems (OS), Microsoft
Windows for example, Ubuntu includes everything you need to get
started, such as an office suite, media tools, a Web browser, a
graphics package, an e-mail client, and more. With the installation
complete, you are up and running straight away. &nbsp;<br>

<br>

Using a computer is a rather individual process, and different people
use their computers in different ways. To help promote this choice,
Linux has the capability to use any one of a number of different
graphical interfaces. This flexibility combined with the ballooning
popularity of Linux and Open Source has resulted in literally hundreds
of different graphical environments spring up, each covering these
different types of users and ways of working. <br>

<br>

Despite this huge range of different environments available, there are
two clear leaders in KDE and GNOME. Both environments provide a
comprehensive and easy to use desktop, but they differ in how that
desktop is used. The KDE system is more akin to Windows and aims for
complete configurability of your desktop. The competing GNOME desktop
shows inspiration from both Windows and Mac OS X and sets as a priority
on simplicity and ease of use. Luckily, Ubuntu users are blessed with
the choice of either desktop-the default desktop in stock Ubuntu is
GNOME, and the Kubuntu distribution uses the KDE desktop. Kubuntu is
covered in Chapter 7. <br>

In this chapter, you get started with GNOME and use it to do the normal
and not-so-normal things you face every day with your computer. This
includes opening and running applications, managing your files,
adjusting the look and feel, using applications, managing your media,
and more. Buckle up and get ready to take your shiny new desktop for a
drive! <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
The Ubuntu Desktop is GNOME</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
When reading about Ubuntu you often see the terms Ubuntu desktop and
GNOME used interchangeably. Both of these terms refer to the same
thing-the Ubuntu desktop uses GNOME itself. There is, however, the
Xubuntu distribution, which takes the Ubuntu OS and replaces it for the
lightweight Xfce environment. This is particularly useful for those of
you who want to run Ubuntu on a lower performance computer.<br>

</div>

<h2>
Taking Your Desktop for a Ride</h2>

When you start your Ubuntu system, you are asked for a username and
password to log in with. In the last chapter you specified a user
account when installing the system, so use that to log in. First type
in your username and press enter, then your password and press enter. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Language? Sprache? Langue? Lingua?</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Click the Options &gt; Select Language button to change the
language of
the desktop. If you click the button and the selection does not include
your language, jump to the Ubuntu In Your Language section to add new
language packs.<br>

</div>

<br>

After a few seconds you will see the Ubuntu desktop appear (See Figure
3-1). <br>

<br>

<a href="3-1.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 964px; height: 603px;" alt="The Ubuntu desktop is simple, uncluttered and...brown." src="3-1.png"></a>
<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 3-1</span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
The Ubuntu desktop is simple, uncluttered and...brown. </span><br>

<br>

The desktop comprises three main areas: <br>

<ul>

  <li>At&nbsp;the top of the screen is the panel. This bar
contains the
desktop menu options and application shortcut icons on the left side as
well as the notification area on the right side. You use this bar to
load applications and to see the status of certain activities on your
system. The panel is always visible when you use your desktop.</li>

  <li>The large middle part of the screen is the desktop. This
part of
the screen is normally covered by the applications that you use, but
you can also put icons and shortcuts on the desktop, too&nbsp;</li>

  <li>The&nbsp;bottom part of the screen is called the
taskbar. This
area displays a rectangle for each application open just like in
Windows. </li>

</ul>

You may have noticed that, unlike other OS, there are no icons on the
desktop. The reason for this is that your icons typically get covered
by applications, and, as such, you can't get at them. If you need to
start applications, you typically use the Applications menu or the
shortcuts. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Device icons</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Although there are no applications on the desktop, when you plug in USB
devices such as portable music players, key rings, or digital cameras a
device icon will appear on the desktop.<br>

</div>

<h2>
Starting Applications and Finding Things</h2>

Starting applications is simple. Just click on the Applications menu on
the left side of the panel. Inside this menu are a number of submenus
for different types of applications. Hover your mouse over each
category, and then click the application that you want to load. As an
example, click on Applications &gt; Internet &gt; Firefox Web
Browser.
After a few seconds the browser will pop up. <br>

<br>

When applications are loaded, the brown window border has three buttons
on the right-hand side: <br>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Left button</span>
(thin white line): This is used to minimize the
application and put it in the taskbar. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Middle&nbsp;button</span>
(white square): This maximizes the
window to take up the full desktop area. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right&nbsp;button</span>
(white cross): This button closes the
application. </li>

</ul>

Every application has an entry in the taskbar at the bottom of the
screen. You can click these entries to minimize or maximize the
application and right-click it to see some other options. <br>

<h2>
Changing Your Menu Layout</h2>

Although the main Applications, Places, and System menus are logical by
default, you may want to further customize them by moving entries into
different submenus, not displaying certain items, and other tweaks. All
of this is easily done with the built in menu editor. <br>

<br>

To edit the menus right-click on a menu, and select Edit Menus. The
menu editor now appears, as seen in Figure 3-2. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-2.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 710px; height: 479px;" alt="The menu editor lets you easily change the Ubuntu menus." src="3-2.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-2</span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
The menu editor lets you easily change the Ubuntu menus. </span><br>

<br>

The menu editor is fairly intuitive. To adjust which items are shown,
click on a submenu, and deselect the items that you don't want
to display. To add a new item, select the submenu the item should
appear in, and then select File &gt; New Entry. The box from Figure
3-3
will appear. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-3.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 393px; height: 241px;" alt="Feel free to add your own menu items." src="3-3.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-3 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Feel free to add your own menu items. </span><br>

<br>

In the Name box enter the name of the application you are adding. In
the Comment box enter a brief description of the application, and then
add the command to run the application in the Command box. You can also
use the "Browse" button to select the application to run. Finally,
click "No Icon," and select an icon for the item. Click "OK" to finish
adding it. <br>

<h2>
Find Your Files and Folders </h2>

When using your computer you often need to save and open files and
folders, move them around, and perform other tasks. The Places menu
contains a bunch of entries to access different parts of you computer
and the network. These include: <br>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Home Folder</span>:
Your home folder is used to store the files
and work
for each user who is logged in. This is the most important folder on
the system, and you can think of it as the equivalent of My Documents
in Windows-virtually everything you save lives here. Each user has a
separate home folder. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Desktop</span>:
The desktop folder is inside your home folder and
contains files that visually appear on your desktop as icons. As such,
if you drag a file onto your desktop, it will appear in the desktop
folder and vice-versa. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Computer</span>:
Clicking this item displays the different drives
attached to your computer as floppy drives, CD/DVD drives, and USB keys
or sticks. This is the equivalent of the My Computer icon in Windows. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Network&nbsp;Servers</span>:
This option accesses servers that
are
available on your local network. This is the equivalent of the Network
Neighborhood in Windows. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Connect&nbsp;to
Server</span>: Click this to run a wizard to
create a
connection to a network server. You can use this to add an icon to the
desktop that, when clicked, provides a list of remote files in the
desktop file manager. You can then treat this window like any other
file manager window and drag files back and forth. This is really
useful for copying files to other computers. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Search&nbsp;for
Files</span>: Use this to search for files on
your computer. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent&nbsp;Documents</span>:
Click this submenu to display
the most recently used documents. </li>

</ul>

<h2>Configure Your System </h2>

The third and final menu, System, is used to configure the
system and customize your desktop. Inside the menu are two submenus. <br>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preferences</span>:&nbsp;
This submenu contains items for
customizing
the look and feel of your desktop. Each of these settings only apply to
the desktop of a user who is logged in. If you log in as another user,
the settings change to that user's preferences. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Administration</span>:
This submenu is used to configure
systemwide
settings such as networking, users, printing, and more. To use these
menu items you need to know the system administrator password</li>

  <ul>

  </ul>

</ul>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Feel the Power</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
When you installed Ubuntu, you were asked for a username and password
for the system. This password not only provides access to your normal
user account but also accesses the all-powerful Administration
features. As such, when you access the menu options and are asked for
the password just enter your normal password, and you can use them. <br>

<br>

This feature only applies to the first user that you created on the
system. If you add another account, the user cannot access the
Administration options unless you explicitly give him or her access. <br>

</div>

<h2>Shortcut Icons</h2>

On the panel there are a number of shortcut icons next to the menus.
These small icons are always visible and can be single-clicked to gain
immediate access to your favorite applications. Ubuntu comes with some
stock shortcuts on the panel, but you are welcome to add your own. <br>

<br>

Adding your own icon is as simple as finding the application you want
to add in the menu and then dragging it to the panel. You can then
right-click the new shortcut icon and select Move to move it to the
right place. <br>

<h2>
Applets</h2>

One of the most useful features in Ubuntu is the ability to run small
programs called applets on the panel. These small programs are useful
for a variety of different tasks, and provide quick and easy access via
the panel. <br>

To add an applet, right-click the panel and select Add to Panel. The
window shown in Figure 3-4 pops up. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-4.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 739px; height: 569px;" alt="Ubuntu comes bundled with a selection of applets." src="3-4.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-4 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Ubuntu comes bundled with a selection of applets.</span><br>

<br>

Select one of the many applets, and click Add. When the applet appears
on the panel, you can press the middle mouse button (or the left and
right buttons together) to move it around. <br>

<h2>
The Notification Area</h2>

In the top right-hand part of the panel is the notification area and
the clock. The notification area is similar to the Windows system tray
in that it provides a series of small icons that indicate something
specific. A good example of this is the battery monitor. This small
icon displays how much power your laptop has left, and when you hover
the mouse over it you can see how much time is left before your
computer gives up the ghost. <br>

You can fiddle with the notification area items by right-clicking them
to view a context menu. Some icons (such as the volume control) allow
you to left-click on them to view them. Try clicking the little speaker
icon and adjusting the slider. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Quick Tip</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Right-click the volume icon, and select Open Volume Control to access
the mixer settings for your sound card. These settings configure the
speakers, microphone, line-in, and any other sound card input or
outputs. <br>

</div>

<h2>
The Clock</h2>

Next to the notification area is the clock. Click on the clock to view
a calendar. Later, when you use Evolution, items that are added to your
calendar appear in the clock applet too. Instead of opening up
Evolution to find out when your dreaded dentist appointment is, just
click on the clock to see it straight away. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Quick Tip</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Customize your click by right-clicking it and selecting Preferences. <br>

</div>

<h2>
The Taskbar</h2>

The taskbar sits at the bottom of the screen. This small bar is always
visible and indicates which applications are currently open. In
addition to this, the taskbar also sneaks in a few other handy little
features. <br>

To the far left of the taskbar is the Hide/Show Desktop button.
Clicking this button hides all of your open applications and shows the
desktop. Clicking it again redisplays them. This button is useful when
you need to quickly access something on your desktop. <br>

<br>

Next to this button is the applications area, which shows each of the
currently open applications. For each application, an entry is added,
and you can right-click it to view a context menu. This menu is used to
minimize, maximize, resize, close, and do other things to the
application.<br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Quick Tip</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
You can switch between multiple applications in Ubuntu just like in
Windows by pressing Alt-Tab. When you press this key combination, a
small window appears that can be used to switch between active
applications. &nbsp;<br>

</div>

<br>

To the right of the applications area are four small rectangles called
the workspaces. Each of these rectangles represents another screen in
which you can view an application. As an example, you may use your Web
browser and e-mail client on the first desktop, talk to your friends on
IRC and instant messenger on the second desktop, listen to your music
in your audio player on the third desktop, and make notes in a text
editor on the fourth one. You can then just click each virtual desktop
to switch to it to access your different applications. Another useful
tip is when moving applications between virtual desktops-if you have an
application on the first desktop, just right-click the brown window or
the taskbar entry, select Move to Another Workspace, and pick the
relevant workspace number. The menu also has Move to Workspace Left and
Move to Workspace Right options, too. This makes moving applications
between your workspaces quite simple.<br>

<br>

To the right of the workspaces is the wastebasket. Files that are
dragged onto this icon are destined to be deleted. To fully delete
these files, right-click the wastebasket and select Empty the
Wastebasket. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Usability and the Ubuntu Desktop</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Throughout the development
of the
Ubuntu desktop, great care and
attention has gone into usability. As an example, the four corners of
the screen are established as areas that are simple to access-you don't
need to carefully mouse over the area and can instead just throw your
mouse to the corner. This is why each corner has an important feature.
It makes accessing each feature that little bit easier.
&nbsp;Ubuntu is
filled with tiny usability improvements such as this that
help make it as intuitive as possible. <br>

</div>

<h2>
Shutting Your Computer Down and Logging Out</h2>

To lock your screen, shut your computer down, log out, hibernate or
suspend, click System &gt; Log Out. You then will see the dialog
box
displayed Figure 3-5. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-5.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 502px; height: 336px;" alt="Who knew that logging out had so many possibilities?" src="3-5.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-5</span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Who knew that logging out had so many possibilities?</span><br>

<br>

There are a number of options here available upon log out. <br>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Log&nbsp;Out</span>:
This option lets you log out of the
current session and go back to the main login screen. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Switch&nbsp;User</span>:
When you click this option, your user
account
remains logged in, but another user account can be used. When the
second account logs out, Ubuntu reverts to the original one. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lock&nbsp;Screen</span>:
This option locks the screen. This is
useful
when you need to use the bathroom or grab some lunch. It will lock the
computer and ask for your password to reenable the desktop. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hibernate</span>:
When you click this option, the current state of
the
system is saved to the hard disk and can be switched off. This is like
the Sleep option, but slow and works on all computers. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Restart</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Click
this to restart the
computer. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shut&nbsp;Down</span>:
Click this to shut down your computer. </li>

</ul>

<h2>
Using Your Applications</h2>

Now that you have gotten used to the desktop, let's explore some of the
many applications included on your new system. By default, Ubuntu comes
with a wide range of popular and established applications to listen to
music, watch videos, create documents, browse the Web, manage your
appointments, read your e-mail, create images and much more. These
applications have been vetted by the developers to ensure they are the
best of breed Linux applications available. <br>

<br>

Although Ubuntu includes a range of different software applications, it
is likely you will want to install extra applications and explore other
software that is available. Fortunately, the Ubuntu system is built on
a powerful foundation which makes software installation as simple as
pointing and clicking. Click Applications &gt; Add Applications and
a
dialog box appears that you can use to install new applications. Just
browse through the different categories and tick the applications to
install. Click the Apply button and the application is downloaded and
installed for you. <br>

<br>

This tool provides a simple way of accessing a limited core set of
popular applications, but there are actually more than 16000 packages
available to your Ubuntu system. Software installation is discussed in
detail in Chapter 4. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Another way of Running Applications</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Although you will most typically start your applications by selecting
them from the Applications menu, you can also press Alt-F2 to bring up
a box to type in the name of an application and run it.<br>

</div>

<h2>
Browsing the Web with Firefox </h2>

Firefox is the default Ubuntu Web browser and provides you will a
simple, safe and powerful browsing experience. Firefox has become one
of the most successful Open Source projects in the world and continues
to garner huge popularity. With more than 150 million downloads, and
rapidly increasing browser share, Firefox has been an unparalleled
success. It really is that cool.<br>

<br>

Fire up Firefox by clicking the blue earth shortcut icon on the panel
or by selecting Applications &gt; Internet &gt; Firefox Web
Browser.
After a few seconds you are presented with the main Firefox window (See
Figure 3-6). <br>

<br>

<br>

<a href="3-6.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 851px; height: 658px;" alt="The Firefox interface is sleek but extensible." src="3-6.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-6 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
The Firefox interface is sleek but extensible. </span><br>

<br>

The Firefox window looks similar to most Web browsers and includes the
staple back, forward, reload, and stop buttons, an address bar, and
some menus. These familiar looking elements help with moving to
Firefox, and if you have used Internet Explorer, Opera, Netscape, or
Safari before, you are sure to pick it up in no time. <br>

<br>

Navigating your way around the Internet is no different in Firefox than
any other browser-just type the Web address into the address bar, and
hit Enter. Firefox also has a few nice features that make it easy
accessing your favorite sites. As an example, if you want to visit the
Ubuntu Web site, you can just enter www.ubuntu.com (leaving off all
that http:// nonsense). Alternatively, you can&nbsp; just type in
"Ubuntu," and Firefox will go off to Google, enter "Ubuntu" as the
search term and take you to the first result in the search. This
feature is incredibly handy for popular sites that are likely to be at
the top of the search results page. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Quick Tip </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
The search box next to the address bar can be used to do a search on
Google straight away. Just type in your search term, and press Enter.
You can also choose other places to search (such as Amazon, eBay, etc.)
by clicking the small icon and selecting a different option. <br>

<br>

This search box can be used to search just about anything. To add more
search engines, click the small icon and then select Add Engines. <br>

</div>

<br>

<h3>
Tabbed Browsing </h3>

If you are anything like any of the authors behind this book, you look
at a number of different Web sites each time you use the Internet. It
is not uncommon to have your Webmail open as well as eBay, some
discussion forums, news sites, blogs, and more. Before long, your
desktop is littered with browser windows, and your taskbar is full to
the brim. <br>

<br>

Firefox has a nimble solution to this problem in the form of tabbed
browsing. If you are looking at your friend's Web site about raccoons
and decide you want to check out your favorite sports player's Web
site, just click File &gt; New Tab or press Ctrl-T and-ta-da!-a new
tab
is unveiled in your browser window. You can now load another page
inside this tab. <br>

<br>

The tabbed browsing fun doesn't stop though-oh no! When you are reading
the Web and you see a link that you are interested in viewing,
right-click the link, and select Open Link in New Tab. The page will
load in the new tab, and you can continue reading the article and view
the link afterwards. &nbsp;<br>

<h3>
Bookmarking Your Favorite Sites </h3>

To bookmark the page you are viewing, click Bookmarks &gt; Bookmark
This Page. In the dialog box that pops up, use the combo box to select
the folder to store the bookmark in. If you want to create a new
folder, click the small arrow button on the right side of the box, and
the box will expand. To create a main folder, select the bookmarks
folder, and click New Folder. You can also create subfolders by
clicking an existing folder and again clicking New Folder. When you
have finished selecting or creating a new folder, click Add to add the
bookmark. <br>

Save Time with Live Bookmarks <br>

<br>

Firefox also includes a special feature called live bookmarks that
automatically grabs content from a Web site without you needing to
visit it. As an example, go to <a href="http://fridge.ubuntu.com/">http://fridge.ubuntu.com/</a>
(a popular
Ubuntu news site), and you will see a small orange icon on the right
side of the address bar. Click this orange square, and a dialog box
pops up to select where to store your bookmark. Use the default option
(the toolbar folder), and click Add. A new toolbar button is added, and
when you click on it a list of the items from the Web site are
displayed. Each time you start Firefox, it will quietly go away and
update this list so that you don't need to visit the site yourself. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
If You Liked the Fridge </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
You may also like Planet Ubuntu at <a href="http://planet.ubuntu.com/">http://planet.ubuntu.com/</a>.
This site
collects together the personal Weblogs of a number of different Ubuntu
developers. Planet Ubuntu gives a unique insight into what the
developers are working on. <br>

</div>

<h3>
Bolt It On, Make It Cool </h3>

Although Firefox is already a powerful and flexible Web browser, it can
be extended even further using special plug-in extensions. These
extensions not only cover typical browsing needs such as the Macromedia
Flash plug-in, it also covers other more specialized extras that extend
the browser itself. <br>

<br>

To install normal Web plug-ins, just visit a site that requires the
plug-in. A yellow bar will appear indicating that you are missing a
plug-in. Click Install Missing Plug-ins button to grab the required
plug-in. By default, Ubuntu does not come with the Macromedia Flash
plug-in, so you will need to install this separately. <br>

To extend the browser itself with additional features, go to
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">https://addons.mozilla.org/</a>
,and browse for an extension that you are
interested in. When you find something you would like to install, click
the Install link. A dialog box will pop up asking you to confirm the
installation. Click Install Now. Your new extension will now download
and install automatically. Typically this requires a restart of
Firefox, and then your extension is available. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Be Careful Where You Download </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
When browsing for extensions, it is recommended you only download
extensions from <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org">http://addons.mozilla.org</a>.
If you do need to install an
extension from another site, make sure it is a site you trust.
Otherwise the extension may contain unsafe software, viruses, or
spyware. <br>

</div>

<h2>
Creating Documents with OpenOffice.org </h2>

Included with Ubuntu is a full office suite called OpenOffice.org. This
comprehensive collection of applications includes a word processor,
spreadsheet, presentations, database, drawing editor, and math editor.
The suite provides an extensive range of functionality, reads and
writes Microsoft Office file formats, and can also export documents as
Web pages, PDF files, and Macromedia Flash animations. <br>

<br>

Let's give OpenOffice.org a whirl by creating a letter with it. Start
OpenOffice.org Writer by selecting it from the Applications &gt;
Office
menu. When it has loaded you will be presented with the interface shown
in Figure 3-7. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-7.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 943px; height: 628px;" alt="OpenOffice.org looks similar to Microsoft Office and is therefore quite" src="3-7.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-7 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
OpenOffice.org looks similar to Microsoft Office and is therefore quite
simple to migrate to. </span><br>

<br>

If you have used a word processor before, much of the common interface
elements such as the font type and size, bold, italic, underline, and
alignment buttons look and behave the same. The OpenOffice.org
developers have designed the suite to be easy to migrate to if you have
used something such as Microsoft Office before. After a few hours
playing with OpenOffice.org you are sure to know how to do what you
need. <br>

Start your letter by first choosing a nice font. In the font combo box
you should see Nimbus Roman selected by default. Click the box and
instead choose the lovely Bitstream Vera Sans font. Also change the
font size by clicking the combo box to the right of the font box and
select 10 as the size. With the cursor currently on the left side of
the page, add your home address to the letter. <br>

<br>

Now press Enter to leave a blank line under the address and click the
Align Right toolbar button (the icon looks like some lines aligned to
the right). If you are unsure of what each button does, hover your
mouse over it, and a tool tip pops up. Now add the address of the
recipient. <br>

<br>

Press enter again to leave a blank line, and type the main body of the
letter. Feel free to use the bold, italic and underline buttons to add
emphasis to your words. You can also use other toolbar buttons to add
items such as bullet points, numbered lists and change the color of the
font. If you want to add features such as graphics, tables, special
characters and frames, click the Insert menu and select the relevant
item. Each item that is added to the page can be customized by
right-clicking it and using the items in the context menu. <br>

<br>

With your letter complete you can now save it by selecting File
&gt;
Save, clicking the floppy disk toolbar icon or by pressing Ctrl-S. The
default file format used by OpenOffice.org is the OpenDocument Format.
This open standard file format is an official open standard and is used
across the world. The file format is slightly different for the
different types of application (.odt for word processor files, .ods for
spreadsheets, etc.), but each format provides an open standard free
from vendor lock-in. You can also save in a variety of other formats,
including Microsoft Office. &nbsp;<br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Vendor Lock-In? </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
In the proprietary software world, it is common for each application to
have their own closed file format that only the vendor knows how to
implement. When a person uses the software to create all their
documents, the closed format means that only that specific tool can
read and write the format. As long as you want to access your
documents, you need that tool. This is known as vendor lock-in. <br>

<br>

To combat this problem, the OpenOffice.org suite (and the vast majority
of other Open Source applications) uses an open file format that is
publicly documented. This means that other applications can implement
the OpenDocument file format, and you can be safe in the knowledge that
your documents will always be available and you are not locked into any
specific tool. <br>

<br>

</div>

Another useful feature wedged into OpenOffice.org is the capability to
save your documents in the Adobe PDF format. PDF files have been
increasingly used in the last few years and are useful for sending
people documents that they should not change (such as invoices). PDF
files provide a high quality copy of the document and are well
supported across all OS. This makes PDFs ideal for creating catalogs,
leaflets, and flyers. To save as a PDF file, click the PDF button on
the main toolbar (next to the printer icon). Click the button, enter a
file name and you are done. Simple. <br>

<h2>
Managing Your E-mail and Calendars with Evolution </h2>

Evolution has been modeled around the all-in-one personal information
management tool. Within Evolution you can read your e-mail, manage your
schedule, store contact details, organize to-do lists, and more in a
single place. This makes evolution particularly useful for business
people who want easy access to this information. <br>

<h3>
Setting Up Your E-Mail Account </h3>

To use evolution to read your e-mail you need to find out the following
settings for connecting to your e-mail server (you can find these
details from your ISP or system administrator): <br>

<ul>

  <li>Your type of e-mail server (such as POP or IMAP) </li>

  <li>Your mail server name (such as mail.chin.com) </li>

  <li>Your mail account's username and password </li>

  <li>Authentication type (typically 'password') </li>

  <li>Your outgoing mail server type (typically SMTP) </li>

  <li>Your outgoing mail server name </li>

</ul>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Evolution and Webmail </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
You can't use Evolution to read Webmail such as Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, or
Hotmail unless you configure your Webmail to output as POP and use SMTP
to send e-mail. Consult your Webmail provider for more details.
<br>

</div>

<br>

Load Evolution by clicking the envelope and clock shortcut icon from
the panel (hover your mouse over the shortcuts to see what they are) or
by clicking Applications &gt; Internet &gt; Evolution Mail.
When the
application loads you are taken through a wizard to set up your e-mail
server (as shown in Figure 3-8). <br>

<br>

<a href="3-8.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 677px; height: 606px;" alt="Setting up Evolution is simple so long as you know the details for your" src="3-8.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-8 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Setting up Evolution is simple so long as you know the details for your
mail server. </span><br>

<br>

Click Forward to continue the setup, and you will then be asked for
your identity. Fill in your e-mail address in the E-mail Address box,
and add the optional information if you want to. The additional details
are not essential for using Evolution. Click Forward to continue. <br>

<br>

You are next asked to choose what kind of e-mail server you have from
the drop-down box. When you make your selection, some additional
settings are displayed. Fill in the server name and the username. You
may need to adjust the Security and Authentication Type settings, but
for most accounts the default settings should be fine. Click Forward to
continue. <br>

<br>

The next page configures some options for receiving your e-mail. None
of these options are essential, although you may want to check the
first box to automatically check for new mail. Click Forward to
continue. The next screen configures sending e-mail. In the combo box
select the Server Type (typically SMTP) and add the server name to the
Server box. Click Forward to continue. <br>

<br>

In the next screen enter a name to describe the account. The default
entry (your e-mail address) is fine, but you may want to add something
more meaningful such as "Work E-mail" or "Home E-mail." When you have
added this, click Forward to continue. Finally, select your location
from the map. If you click on your area of the world, the map will zoom
in. Once you have done this click Apply to complete the process and
close the wizard. <br>

With the wizard completed, the main Evolution interface will appear as
shown in Figure 3-9. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-9.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 872px; height: 643px;" alt="Those of you who have used Microsoft Outlook should find the interface" src="3-9.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-9 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Those of you who have used Microsoft Outlook should find the interface
very similar. </span><br>

<br>

On the left sidebar you can see a number of buttons to access the mail,
contacts, calendars, memos, and tasks components in Evolution. When you
click each button the interface adjusts to show you the relevant
information about that component. &nbsp;<br>

<h3>
Working with Your E-Mail </h3>

Inside the e-mail component you can see the e-mail folders in the left
panel and the list of messages in the top pane. When you click on a
message, it is displayed in the bottom pane where you can read it. With
your new account set up you will first want to go and grab the e-mail
from your mail server. Click Send/Receive, and the mail is retrieved
from your server and any unsent mail is sent. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Problems? </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
If you cannot connect to your mail server, there may be an error in
your account configuration. To edit your account settings again, click
Edit &gt; Preferences, select the account from the list, and click
Edit. <br>

</div>

<br>

With you messages loaded, new e-mails are shown in bold in the top
pane. Move through the different e-mails using the up and down arrow
keys, and each message will be displayed. You can reply to a message by
clicking the Reply or Reply To All toolbar buttons. New e-mails can be
sent by clicking the New toolbar button. By default, new e-mails and
replies are sent automatically when you click the Send button in the
compost window. This way you don't need to click the Send/Receive
button to deliver them. <br>

<h3>
Managing Your Calendar </h3>

Inside calendar mode, Evolution provides a convenient way of managing
your schedule, adding new events, and viewing your calendar in
different ways. When you click the Calendar button to enable this mode,
you can see the timetable for today as well as the month view. The
month view shows a couple of months in which the bold dates have
events. <br>

<br>

There are two types of event you can add to your calendar. <br>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meetings</span>:
These are events with a specific group of people. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Appointments</span>:
These are general events. </li>

</ul>

To add a new appointment, find the date for the event in the
month view, right-click the Today view, and select New Appointment. In
the box that pops up, fill in the Summary, Location, Time, and
Description boxes. You can also use the Calendar combo box to select
which calendar the event appears on. <br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<h4>Multiple Calendars </h4>

Evolution supports multiple calendars. This is useful if you want
different calendars for different types of events such as personal and
work related activities. To create a new calendar, right-click the
calendar list in the left sidebar and select New Calendar. <br>

</div>

<br>

To add a new meeting, again find the date, right-click the Today view,
and select New Meeting. Inside the dialog box that pops up, you need to
add the participants who are attending the meeting. You can add
participants in two ways: Use the Add button if they are not in your
address book, or use the Attendees button if they are in your address
book. <br>

<br>

When you click Attendees,, a new dialog pops up with a list of
attendees down the left and you can use the Add and Remove buttons to
select a contact and add them to the different categories of Chair
Persons, Required Participants, Optional Participants, and Resources.
Now, you probably don't have any contacts in there as you are just
starting to use Evolution, so use the main Contacts button on the left
side of the main Evolution window to add some. <br>

<br>

You can view your calendar in lots of different ways by clicking the
different toolbar buttons such as Week, Month, and List. Have a play
with them and see which ones are most useful to you. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Quick Tip </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Remember, your appointments can be accessed without opening Evolution
by clicking on the clock in the panel. <br>

</div>

<h2>
Create Graphics with the GIMP </h2>

The GNU Image Manipulation Package, affectionately known as the GIMP to
its friends, is a powerful graphics package. The GIMP provides a
comprehensive range of functionality for creating different types of
graphics. It includes tools for selections, drawing, creating paths,
masks, filters, effects, and more. It also includes a range of
templates for different types of media such as Web banners, different
paper sizes, video frames, CD covers, floppy disk labels, and even
toilet paper. Yes, toilet paper. You can load the GIMP by clicking
Applications &gt; Graphics &gt; GIMP Image Editor. <br>

<br>

Unlike Adobe Photoshop, the GIMP does not place all of its windows
inside a single large window, and instead has a number of separate
child windows. This can be a little confusing at first for new users.
To get you started, let us run through a simple session in the GIMP. <br>

<h3>
An Example </h3>

Start the GIMP by clicking Applications &gt; Graphics &gt; GIMP
Image Editor. <br>

<br>

When the gimp loads you will see a collection of different windows as
shown in Figure 3-10. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-10.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 813px; height: 627px;" alt="The GIMP does not put everything in one window like Adobe Photoshop." src="3-10.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-10 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
The GIMP does not put everything in one window like Adobe Photoshop. </span><br>

<br>

Close the Tip of the Day window, and you are left with two other
windows. The one on the left in the above screenshot is the main tool
palette. This window provides you with a range of different tools that
can be used to create your images. The window on the right provides
details of layers, brushes, and other information. The GIMP provides a
huge range of different windows that are used for different things and
this is just one of them. <br>

<br>

To create a new image, click File &gt; New. The window shown in
Figure 3-11 will appear. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-11.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 392px; height: 302px;" alt="There are lots of templates available, including one for toilet paper!" src="3-11.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-11 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
There are lots of templates available, including one for toilet paper! </span><br>

<br>

The easiest way to get started is to select one of the many templates.
Click the Template combo box and select 640x480. If you click the
Advanced Options expander you can also select the type of color used in
the image with the Colorspace box and how the background is filled. The
Fill combo box is useful for either selecting a fill color or having a
transparent background. <br>

<br>

Click OK, and you will see your new image (Figure 3-12). <br>

<br>

<a href="3-12.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 696px; height: 615px;" alt="Use the right mouse button on the image to access lots of GIMP options" src="3-12.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-12 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Use the right mouse button on the image to access lots of GIMP options
and features. </span><br>

<br>

To work on your image, use the tool palette to select which tool you
want to use on the new image window. Each time you click on a tool in
the palette, you see options for the tool appear at the bottom of the
palette window. <br>

<br>

When you click the T button in the palette, it selects the text tool.
At the bottom of the palette you see the different options. Click the
Font button, and select the Sans Bold font. Now click the up arrow on
the Size box, and select the size as 45. Move your mouse over to the
empty image, and you will see the mouse pointer changes to a text
carat. Click in the image, and a box pops up in which you can enter the
text to add to the image. Type in "Ubuntu." With the text entry still
open, click the up arrow on the Size box so the text fills most of the
window. As you can see, you can adjust the text while it is in the
image. When you are happy with the formatting, click Close button on
the text entry box. Your image should look a little like Figure
3-13. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-13.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 696px; height: 615px;" alt="Ubuntu comes with a range of attractive fonts for use in your images." src="3-13.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 3-13 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Ubuntu comes with a range of attractive fonts for use in your images. </span><br>

<br>

Now click the button in the palette with four arrows on it. You can use
this to move the text around. Click the black text, and move the mouse.
<br>

<br>

Let's now add an effect filter. The GIMP comes with a range of
different filters built in. You can access these by right-clicking the
image and selecting the Filters submenu. The GIMP also allows you to
create scripts that combine filters together to create interesting
combinations. Again, a number of these scripts are included, and you
can access them by right-clicking the image and selecting the Python-Fu
and Script-Fu submenus. <br>

<br>

For our image, right-click the image and select Filters &gt; Blur
&gt;
Gaussian Blur. In the Horizontal and Vertical boxes select 20 as the
value. Click OK to apply the effect. After a few seconds the blur is
applied to your text. Anything in the GIMP can be undone by clicking
Edit &gt; Undo or typing Ctrl-Z. Your image should now look like
Figure
3-14. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-14.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 696px; height: 615px;" alt="There are lots of filters and effects bundled with the GIMP on your" src="3-14.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-14 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
There are lots of filters and effects bundled with the GIMP on your
computer. </span><br>

<br>

Now we are going to create another layer and put some text over our
blurred text to create an interesting effect. In your image window,
click Dialogues &gt; Layers. The layers window now appears (Figure
3-15). <br>

<br>

<a href="3-15.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 323px; height: 303px;" alt="Layers are essential when creating complex images with lots of parts." src="3-15.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-15 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Layers are essential when creating complex images with lots of parts. </span><br>

<br>

Layers are like clear plastic sheets that can be stacked on top of each
other. They allow you to create some imagery on one layer and then
create another layer on top with some other imagery. When combined,
layers can create complex looking images that are easily editable by
only editing the layer you want. Currently, our blurred text is on a
layer. Add a new layer by clicking the paper icon in the layers dialog
box. Another window appears to configure the layer. The defaults are
fine (a transparent layer the size of your image), so click OK. <br>

<br>

Now double-click the black color chip in the palette window and select
a light color. You can do this by moving the mouse in the color range
and then clicking OK when you find a color you are happy with. Now
click the text button from the palette and again add the Ubuntu text.
When the text is added it will be the same size as before. Now use the
move tool and position it over the blurred text. Now you have the word
"Ubuntu" with a healthy glow as shown in Figure 3-16! <br>

<br>

<a href="3-16.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 696px; height: 615px;" alt="Combining steps as we have done can result in interesting effects such" src="3-16.png"></a><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-16 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Combining steps as we have done can result in interesting effects such
as this. </span><br>

<br>

The final step is to crop the image to remove the unused space in the
image. Click Tools &gt; Transform Tools &gt; Crop&nbsp;
&gt; Resize and
use the mouse to draw around the Ubuntu word. You can use the black
pins on the outside of the selection to move it more precisely. Click
Crop, and the image now cropped. To save your work, click File &gt;
Save, and enter a filename. You can use the Select File Type expander
to select from one of the many different file formats. <br>

<h2>
Communicate with Gaim </h2>

With the Internet steamrolling its way across the world, the ubiquitous
global network has become a part of everyday life and something that
you can reasonably assume people have access to. This has in turn
spawned a range of Web-based services and interestingly, a variety of
methods of communicating with each other. <br>

<br>

Included with Ubuntu is Gaim, a cornucopia of different methods of
instantly messaging your friends from within a single program. Instead
of having to install a separate client application to talk to your
friends on MSN, AIM, ICQ, and Jabber, Gaim can do it all in one place. <br>

<br>

Gaim is available by clicking Applications &gt; Internet &gt;
Gaim Instant Messenger. <br>

<h3>
Setting Up Your Accounts </h3>

When you start Gaim, the first step is to create an account for each
different type of network you want to use. Click the Accounts button
the main screen and the Accounts dialog box will appear. Click the Add
button to add a new account and the Add Account box appears (Figure
3-17). <br>

<br>

<a href="3-17.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 314px; height: 459px;" alt="Many different types of account (MSN, AIM, Jabber, ICQ, IRC, etc.) are" src="3-17.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-17 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Many different types of account (MSN, AIM, Jabber, ICQ, IRC, etc.) are
supported in Gaim. </span><br>

<br>

This window adjusts which text boxes are available depending on the
Protocol chosen. The different networks available are listed as options
in the Protocol box. To create an account you will need to have an
existing account on one of the networks. Gaim allows you to have
different accounts on different networks running together-you just
create a new account for each protocol. <br>

<br>

When you have selected a Protocol, fill in the remaining boxes. The
Screen Name box needs to contain your registered username (or e-mail
address for MSN), and the password box needs the respective password to
be added. You can also use the Alias box to add an interesting name
that is displayed when other people see you online. If you want to
configure any other options, click the Show More Options expander. <br>

<h3>
Using Instant Messaging </h3>

With your account(s) set up, click Sign On to log on. When you are
logged in, your friends list (known as buddies in Gaim) are displayed
(Figure 3-18). <br>

<br>

<a href="3-18.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 650px; height: 292px;" alt="Gaim provides quick and easy access to your buddies-just click them to" src="3-18.png"></a><br>

talk! </span><br>

<br>

You can use the Buddies menu option to add more buddies to the list
with the Add Buddy option. To speak to a buddy, double-click the name,
and a window will pop up. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Using IRC </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Included in Gaim is support for IRC channels, and it has a very nice
interface for IRC discussion. To use the IRC feature, first create an
account. Next, sign on, and then click Buddies &gt; Add Chat and
enter
the IRC channel name in the Channel box. Finally, double-click on the
channel name to go to it. <br>

</div>

<h2>
Cutting-Edge Voice Over IP with Ekiga </h2>

Included with Ubuntu is a simple to use yet powerful Internet phone
called Ekiga. Formally known as GNOME Meeting, Ekiga lets you make
voice and video calls with other people across the Internet. In
addition to the traditional Microsoft Netmeeting support, Ekiga now
supports SIP, a protocol that is commonly used to allow people with
software phones such as Ekiga to communicate with people using hardware
Voice Over IP phones. SIP is an industry standard that many hardware
phones, software phones, services, and providers support. <br>

<br>

If you choose to use SIP, calls from one phone to another across the
Internet are free. In addition to this, many providers allow you to
make calls to normal land line phones for very little. Ekiga offers you
the possibility to call anyone in the world directly from your computer
with little fuss. <br>

<br>

You can access Ekiga by clicking Applications &gt; Internet
&gt; Ekiga Softphone. <br>

<h3>
Setting Up </h3>

When you first start Ekiga, you are guided through a setup wizard
(Figure 3-19). <br>

<br>

<a href="3-19.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 661px; height: 482px;" alt="Setting up Ekiga is simple wit the setup wizard." src="3-19.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-19 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">

<br>

Click Forward to get started, and you see the next page (Figure 3-20). <br>

<br>

<a href="3-20.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 661px; height: 482px;" alt="Adding your name makes it easier for people to find you online." src="3-20.png"></a><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Adding your name makes it easier for people to find you online. </span><br>

<br>

In this box, enter your first and second name (such as Susan Curtis).
Click Forward to continue. <br>

<br>

You can now configure an Ekiga.net account (Figure 3-21). <br>

<br>

<a href="3-21.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 661px; height: 482px;" alt="Ekiga.net offer a free SIP service." src="3-21.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-21 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Ekiga.net offer a free SIP service. </span><br>

<br>

At Ekiga.net, a free SIP service is offered. If you don't have an
account (which is likely if this is the first time you have used
Ekiga), click the Get an Ekiga.net SIP account button. Firefox is then
loaded, and you can use the online form to sign up. If you don't want
an account, just select the checkbox in the wizard saying you don't
want to sign up. If you do sign up, add your username and password, and
then click Forward. <br>

<br>

Now you can configure your connection speed (Figure 3-22). <br>

<br>

<a href="3-22.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 661px; height: 482px;" alt="Be honest here-selecting a faster speed won't make it any quicker!" src="3-22.png"></a><br>

Figure 3-22 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Be honest here-selecting a faster speed won't make it any quicker! </span><br>

<br>

Just select the type of connection you have, and then click Forward. <br>

<br>

Traditionally, one of the problems in the past with Internet phones has
been that you need to modify your firewall (if you are running one) to
get it working. This typically involved configuring how your Network
Address Translation (NAT) settings. Luckily, Ekiga can detect the type
of NAT settings that you need (Figure 3-23). <br>

<br>

<a href="3-23.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 663px; height: 485px;" alt="Traditionally, setting up NAT with Internet phones was a pain-until" src="3-23.png"></a><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-23 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Traditionally, setting up NAT with Internet phones was a pain-until
now. </span><br>

<br>

After a few seconds of detecting your type of NAT it will propose an
option. Click Yes to continue, and then click Forward. <br>

<br>

Next you configure your audio (Figure 3-24). <br>

<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Remember to look your best online! </span><br>

<br>

Ensure your camera is plugged in, and select a device from the combo
box. If you can't see any options, you will need to configure your
camera driver first. When you have selected a device, click Test
Settings to verify that it works. <br>

<br>

Finally, a summary of your options are displayed (Figure 3-28). <br>

<br>

<a href="3-28.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 661px; height: 482px;" alt="Now you are all set to make calls." src="3-28.png"></a><br>

<h2>
The Ubuntu File Chooser and Bookmarks </h2>

One area in which the GNOME developers have worked hard is to create an
intuitive and useful file chooser that is accessed in applications with
File &gt; Open. You may be wondering why they have spent so much
time
on such a small and seemingly insignificant part of the desktop. In
reality however, finding files is one of the most frustrating aspects
of using computers and often involves digging through folder after
folder to find what you need. Luckily, the GNOME file chooser helps cut
down much of this file hunting significantly. <br>

The file chooser is shown in Figure 3-37. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-37.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 634px; height: 453px;" alt="The file chooser has a number of subtle features such as bookmarks." src="3-37.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-37 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
The file chooser has a number of subtle features such as bookmarks. </span><br>

<br>

The listing of files on the right hand side is used to find the file
you need, and you can click on folders in this listing to traverse
deeper into your subfolders. Note how each folder is displayed above
the listing in a series of buttons. You can click these buttons to
easily jump back to parent folders when needed. <br>

<br>

Aside from manually picking files, the chooser also supports bookmarks.
On the left side of the chooser there is a list of devices and
bookmarks. These include Home (your home directory), Desktop (the files
on your desktop), Filesystem (the entire hard drive), as well as
devices such as CD drives, Floppy drives, and USB sticks. <br>

<br>

To create your own bookmark, use the listing on the right to find the
folder that you want to bookmark, single-click it, and then click Add
below the bookmarks box. The folder now appears in the bookmarks. Now
whenever you need to access that folder, just click the bookmark! In
addition to putting the bookmark in the file chooser, it is also
available in other parts of the desktop such as the Places menu and in
the file manager. <br>

<h2>
Ubuntu in Your Language </h2>

When you installed Ubuntu, you were asked which language the system
should use. Although this sets the initial language for the system, you
may want to change the language at a later date. To do this click
System &gt; Administration &gt; Language Selector. <br>

<br>

Ubuntu supports a huge range of different languages, and many
applications include a Translate This Application menu option in the
Help menu so that normal Ubuntu users can contribute translations in
their language. If you would like help with this effort, it is a
fantastic contribution to the Ubuntu project.<br>

<br>

When the language selector first loads, it may ask you to update your
Language Packs. Just click Yes to continue. Inside the dialog box a
number of languages are listed, each of which has&nbsp;
Translations
and Writing Aids checkboxes. For each language that you want available
on the system, check the relevant boxes. The Translations box should be
checked for menus, labels and buttons to be translated, and the Writing
Aids box should be checked to install dictionaries and grammar
checkers.<br>

<br>

When you have selected the boxes, click the Apply button, and the
appropriate language packs are downloaded and installed. Now use the
Default Language combo box to choose the new language. You need to log
out and log back in for the changes to take effect.<br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Choosing a New Language </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
When you see the login screen, you can use the Language button to
choose a language for that specific login session. When you select the
language you are asked if you want to make it the default language or
use it just for that specific session. <br>

</div>

<h2>
Customizing Ubuntu's Look and Feel </h2>

Whenever I have put someone in front of Ubuntu for the first time,
there seems a uniform natural desire to tweak the look and feel of the
desktop. In our increasingly diverse society, everyone is different,
and everyone's tastes are equally individual and unique. It can be fun
tweaking our desktops so they look just right, and Ubuntu has great
support for all kinds of adjustments to your desktop. Do you want
different looking applications with a lime green background and crazy
fonts? No problem, just don't show it to anyone else... <br>

<h3>
Changing the Background </h3>

To change the background of your desktop right-click it and select
Change Desktop Background. Inside the dialog box that appears, choose
your wallpaper by clicking on an image and the desktop background will
automatically change. Ubuntu comes with a limited range of preinstalled
wallpapers, so it is likely that you will want to add your own
wallpaper. To do this, save your wallpaper somewhere on your computer,
and then use the Add Wallpaper button to select it. The new wallpaper
can be selected from the list.<br>

<br>

If you are not really a wallpaper kind of person and would prefer just
a color for the background, you can use the Desktop Colors controls at
the bottom of the dialog box. The combo box provides three different
types of background: Solid Color, Horizontal Gradient, and Vertical
Gradient. Next to the combo box you click on the color chip to select
the relevant color(s). <br>

<h3>
Changing the Theme </h3>

When you are using your applications, the visual appearance of the
buttons, scroll bars, widgets, and other bits and pieces are controlled
by the Theme. The built-in theming system can make your applications
look radically different, and Ubuntu ships a number of themes with it
that you can try. <br>

<h3>
Choosing a New Theme </h3>

To choose a new theme click System &gt; Preferences &gt; Theme.
Inside
the dialog box that pops up are a number of themes that you can choose.
Just click on a theme and the desktop will be adjusted automatically.
You can further customize your theme by clicking the Theme Details
button. A new dialog box appears that has tabs for the different parts
of the theme you can configure. Click each tab and select an entry from
the list to create your own perfect theme. <br>

<h3>
Installing New Themes </h3>

To install a new theme first head over to <a href="http://art.gnome.org/">http://art.gnome.org/</a>,
and
find a theme that you like. You need to look for Application Themes
when browsing the site. When you find a theme that you like, download
it to your computer. Now Click System &gt; Preferences
&gt;&nbsp;
Themes and click the Install Theme button. Using the file chooser, find
the theme that you just downloaded and it will install automatically.
Now select your new theme from the list. <br>

<h3>
Configuring a Screensaver </h3>

To choose a different screensaver click System &gt; Preferences
&gt;
Screensaver. The screensaver configuration tool then loads (Figure
3-38). <br>

<br>

<br>

<a href="3-38.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 643px; height: 479px;" alt="A number of screensavers are bundled with Ubuntu" src="3-38.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-38 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
A number of screensavers are bundled with Ubuntu </span><br>

<br>

On the left side of the window is a list of available screensavers.
Click on a screensaver and you will see a preview appear in the space
to the right of the list. You can then use the slider to select how
long the computer needs to be idle for before the screensaver kicks in.
<br>

<br>

The Lock Screen When Screensaver Is Active checkbox can be selected to
lock the screen when the screensaver starts, and, as such, require the
user to enter their password to reactivate the desktop. This is useful
if you work in an office and want to ensure that no one tampers with
your computer when you are away. <br>

<h2>
Managing Your Files </h2>

Files are the meat and potatoes of any computer, and they need to be
managed, copied, moved, renamed, grouped, and loaded. Included with
Ubuntu is a powerful yet simple file manager called Nautilus that
integrates tightly into your desktop. <br>

<br>

Nautilus makes extensive use of drag and drop. Unlike the kind of file
manager used in Windows with its tree view and listing of files,
Nautilus displays files in a series of windows in which you can drag
files around easily. For those who just can't say goodbye to the tree
view, Nautilus also supports that. Aside from providing a simpler user
interface, Nautilus also includes a number of useful features such as
video and image previews, emblems, bookmarks, permissions management,
and more. <br>

<h3>
How Linux Stores and Organizes Files </h3>

Before we use Nautilus it would be worthwhile to have a crash course in
how files and folders are organized on a Linux system. If you have not
used Linux before, this is likely to be new to you as the layout it is
quite different from Windows and Mac OS X. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Folder and Directories </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
When reading about file management, don't get confused by the terms
"folders" and "directories"-both words describe the same thing.
<br>

</div>

<br>

In the Windows world each disk drive is labeled with an identifying
letter such as C: for your hard disk and A: for the floppy drive. In
the Linux world, however, everything is part of the same file system
organization. As such, if you have two or three hard disks, a CD drive,
and USB stick all plugged in, they will all be part of the same folder
structure. <br>

<br>

The diagram shown in Figure 3-39 should give you an idea of how
everything hangs together. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-39.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 733px; height: 458px;" alt="Linux file system organization" src="3-39.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-39 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Linux file system organization </span><br>

<br>

Right at the top of the tree is the root folder, referred to as /.
Inside this folder there are a number of special system folders, each
with a specific use. As an example, the /home folder contains a number
of home directories for each user on the system. As such, the jono user
account has the home folder set to /home/jono. <br>

<h3>
Which Folder Does What? </h3>

The folder structure in a modern Linux distribution such as Ubuntu was
largely inspired by the original UNIX foundations that were created by
men with large beards and sensible jumpers. Although you don't really
need to know what these folders do, since Ubuntu looks after the
housekeeping for you, some of you may be interested in the more
important folders. For your pleasure, we present the Linux folder hit
list in Table 3-1. <br>

<h3>
Configuration Files </h3>

In the above table, /etc is described as storing systemwide
configuration files for your computer. Aside from these files that
affect everyone, there are also configuration files for each specific
user. Earlier, when you customized Ubuntu's&nbsp; look and feel,
the
settings were only applied to your current user account. So where are
those settings stored? <br>

<br>

Inside your home directory there are a number of folders that begin
with a dot (.) such as .gnome2 and .openoffice2. These folders contain
the configuration settings for specific applications for that specific
user. By default these dot folders are hidden in Nautilus as you rarely
need to access them. For future reference you can view these hidden
files and folders by clicking View &gt; Show Hidden Files. <br>

<br>

You can start Nautilus from a number of different places such as
Applications &gt; Accessories &gt; File Browser or more
commonly by
clicking Places &gt; Home Folder to load your home folder. When the
folder loads, you should see something similar to what is shown in
Figure 3-40. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-40.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 830px; height: 521px;" alt="Accessing your home folder files is as simple as clicking Places" src="3-40.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-40 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Accessing your home folder files is as simple as clicking Places
&gt; Home Folder. </span><br>

<br>

The Nautilus window is split into two different parts. The sidebar
shows categories of information such as bookmarks, folders, emblems
(more on these later), and more. In the main part of the window you can
see the subfolders and files in the current folder. By default,
Nautilus displays your bookmarks in the left sidebar and displays the
contents of your home folder. <br>

<br>

So, let's have a play with Nautilus and what you can do with it. The
first important skills to learn are general file management. Many of
the tasks you need to do can be achieved by right-clicking your
file/folder and selecting the relevant option. There are also a number
of options in the Edit menu. <br>

<br>

First create a folder. Do this by right-clicking the main part of the
window and selecting Create Folder. A folder is added, and you can type
in the name of it. If you change your mind about the name, rename it by
right-clicking, and selecting Rename. If you double-click on a folder,
you can access it and perform the same operations in that subfolder.
&nbsp;<br>

<br>

Nautilus is also flexible in how your files are displayed. You can view
the files and folders as either the default collection of icons or as a
list. To switch to the list view, select View &gt; View As List.
You
can also configure the organization of how your files and folders are
displayed by right-clicking the main part of the window and select one
of the options in the Arrange Items menu. Play with each of these
options to see which ones work best for you. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Quick Tip </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Just like in the file
dialog, Nautilus displays each of the different
parts of the path as different buttons. As an example, /home/jono/work
would have three buttons: home, jono, and work. <br>

</div>

<h3>
Selecting, Copying, and Moving Files/Folders </h3>

Copying and moving files and folders are simple with Nautilus and can
be done in a number of different ways. To test this, create two folders
in your home directory called Work and Invoices. Save some files inside
each folder. You can quickly create empty files by double-clicking the
folder to go into it, right-clicking, selecting Create Document
&gt;
Empty File, and renaming the file to something useful. With a couple of
folders now complete with files in them, let's move them around. <br>

<br>

One method is to use two windows. Right-click the Work folder, and
select Open in New Window. You now have two windows open, one with the
contents of Work and one with the contents of your home directory. Now
copy the Invoices folder to the Work folder by clicking it and dragging
it over to the second window (which shows the contents of Work). By
default, dragging from one window to another copies the item. <br>

Another option is to select what you want to copy and paste it.
Selecting items can again be done in a number of ways. One method is to
click each file/folder while holding down the Shift or Ctrl keys to
make multiple selections. The difference between the two keys is that
Shift will allow you select a number of files/folders next to each
other and Ctrl selects independent files and folders from anywhere in
the folder listing view. When you have selected what should be copied,
right-click and select Cut or Copy. Cut will copy the original files
but remove them and Copy will just copy them while leaving the original
files intact. Now go to the destination folder, right-click it, and
select Paste. The files/folders are now added. <br>

<h3>
Using the Sidebar </h3>

The sidebar in Nautilus can be changed to a variety of different views
that should cater to virtually all tastes. Each of these different
sidebar views has a range of different functions. Table 3-2
explains each one. <br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Table 3-2 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
The different Nautilus sidebar options </span><br>

<br>

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

  <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td>OPTION </td>

      <td>FEATURE </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>Places </td>

      <td>This is the default view, and includes the devices and
bookmarks in the sidebar that you typically see in the file chooser. </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>Information </td>

      <td>Displays some limited information about the current
folder. </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>Tree </td>

      <td>Displays a tree view similar to Windows/Mac OS X. Those
of you who love the way Windows/Mac OS X works may want to use this. </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>History </td>

      <td>Displays a history of the folders that you have clicked
on. </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>Notes </td>

      <td>This useful little feature allows you to write notes in
the sidebar
that are stored in the folder. This is handy when you need to explain
or make comments about the current folder. </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>Emblems </td>

      <td>List the files and folders that have specific emblems
attached. Emblems are discussed in the next section. </td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

Although you will no doubt stick with one in particular, it is not
uncommon to switch between options to achieve a particular task. For
this reason, the flexibility provided by the range of sidebar options
is useful. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Drag and Drop </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
If you want to put something in the Places view, drag and drop the
item. The Ubuntu Desktop is filled with drag and drop shortcuts like
this. If you think something could be dragged and dropped, try
it! <br>

</div>

<h3>
Using Emblems </h3>

Emblems give you the ability to tag files and folders to indicate
something. These small graphical icons are used to say that the
file/folder falls into a particular category, visually signified by the
emblem. As an example, you may want to tag a file to indicate it is a
draft. <br>

<br>

When you select the Emblems sidebar, a range of different emblems
appears. To apply an emblem to a file/folder, just drag the emblem onto
it. You can drag multiple emblems onto the files to indicate multiple
things. &nbsp;<br>

<h2>
Ubuntu and Multimedia </h2>

In recent years, multimedia has become an essential part of computing.
Watching DVDs and videos and listening to CDs and music have become
part and parcel of the modern desktop computer experience. These
multimedia capabilities have been further bolstered by the huge
popularity of legal music downloading. With a range of online shops for
a variety of different types of music, it is not uncommon to listen to
the majority of your music without ever seeing a little shiny silver
disc. <br>

<h3>
Installing Codecs </h3>

Multimedia files and discs come in a variety of different types, and
each type uses a special codec to compress the content to a smaller
size while retaining a particular level of quality. To play this media,
you need to ensure that you have the relevant codecs installed. <br>

<br>

Unfortunately, codecs have traditionally been something of a problem
with Open Source software due to the legal restrictions placed upon
them. The problem is that many codecs (including MP3, Windows Media
Format, QuickTime, and Realmedia) are proprietary and have restrictions
placed on their use, distribution, and licensing. <br>

Although developers in the Open Source community have gone away and
created free implementations of these codecs, the licensing that
surrounds them conflicts with the legal and philosophical position that
Ubuntu has set. Not only are these codecs not included because they are
legally iffy, but because they disagree with Ubuntu's ethic of creating
a distribution that is entirely comprised of free software in the
freest sense of the word. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Quick Tip </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
If you want to find out more about installing these codecs, see
<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats</a>.
<br>

</div>

<br>

To work toward resolving these problems, a number of developers are
working on free codecs such as Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora that provide
high quality results and open licensing. The Ogg Vorbis codec is used
on audio and can provide better results than MP3 at a smaller file
size. The Ogg Theora codec is used for video and competes with the
MPEG-4 codec. Ubuntu includes the Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora codecs, and
you can encode and play back any media that uses those codecs. <br>

<br>

Although the world would be a better place if all codecs were free, the
reality is different and many Ubuntu users still want to play their
media on their new desktop. Table 3-3 shows the most typical
codecs used to encode and play back media, and lists their support in
Ubuntu. <br>

<h3>
Listening to Audio Files </h3>

Ubuntu includes a powerful music player called Rhythmbox to organize
and play your music file collection. Before you fire up Rhythmbox
though, you need to create a folder to store your music files in. This
folder can be anywhere, but putting it on the desktop makes sense,
since it will then be easily accessible when you want to add new songs
to it. <br>

<br>

Right-click your desktop, and select Create Folder. A new folder is
created, and you should enter a name for it. Call it "Music" for now.
Within this directory, organize your music in a way that makes sense to
you. A good system that many people use is to first give each
artist/band a folder and then inside each folder have a subfolder for
each album that contains the songs. So, as an example, inside the Music
folder you would have an Overkill folder inside of which there would be
a Horrorscope folder that contains the individual songs. You don't need
to use this system if you don't want to, but as your music collection
builds it makes sense to organize it this way. Many CD rippers also
store songs in this way, so you should not need to reconfigure your CD
ripper later. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Quick Tip </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Why not add your new music folder as a bookmark so it appears in the
file chooser, Places menu, and elsewhere? <br>

</div>

<h3>
Using Rhythmbox </h3>

Load Rhythmbox (See Figure 3-41) by clicking on Applications
&gt; Sound &amp; Video &gt; Rhythmbox Music Player. When
Rhythmbox
first starts it asks you to select the directory where your music is
stored, so select your Music folder. To import your music, right-click
the Library entry in the left panel and select Import Folder. Your
songs are added to your music collection. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-41.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 765px; height: 570px;" alt="Rhythmbox is a great place to look after your music collection." src="3-41.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-41 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Rhythmbox is a great place to look after your music collection. </span><br>

<br>

The Rhythmbox window is split into a number of different panes, each
displaying different details about your music collection. The left pane
(Source) lets you select the source of the music such as your media
library, podcasts and Internet radio. Each of these options has a
browser pane available to display the source of the content. As an
example, when you use the Library, a pane displaying the artists and
one displaying the albums are displayed. You can use this to navigate
your music. <br>

<h4>
Listening to Podcasts </h4>

Podcasts are audio shows that you can subscribe to, and they are
increasingly becoming the new way to listen to audio and music. When
you subscribe to a podcast, each new release is automatically
downloaded for you. This makes it extremely convenient to regularly
listen to audio shows. <br>

<br>

If you are new to podcasting you should go and grab yourself a podcast
feed of something you like. A site such as www.podcast.net is a good
place to start. Go to the site in Firefox, and when you see a link
saying podcast feed or RSS feed, right-click it, and select Copy Link
Location. <br>

<br>

Rhythmbox has good support for Podcast feeds and subscribing to a feed
is simple. In the sidebar, right-click the Podcast entry and click New
Podcast Feed. Paste in the feed by right-clicking the box and selecting
Paste. The files are automatically downloaded and you can listen to
them by double-clicking on them. Each time you start Rhythmbox a check
is made to see if any new episodes exist, and if so, they are
downloaded. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Rhythmbox and iPods </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Rhythmbox can also read songs from your iPod-just plug it in and it
will display in Rhythmbox. &nbsp;Unfortunately Rhythmbox can only
read from the iPod at the moment and not write to it. <br>

</div>

<h3>
Playing and Ripping CDs </h3>

When you pop a CD into your CD drive, an application called Sound
Juicer automatically loads to play your CD. If you are connected to the
Internet, the CD is looked up on the Internet, and the album details
and song titles are displayed. <br>

<h4>
Ripping Songs as Oggs </h4>

Sound Juicer is not just a CD player, but a ripper too. Using a ripper
you can convert the songs on the CD into files that you can play on
your computer. By default, Sound Juicer rips the files in the Ogg
format, which provides better sound quality than MP3 at a smaller size.
Before you rip the CD, click Edit &gt; Preferences, and use the
Music
Folder combo box to select the Music folder that you created earlier to
store your music files. If you have not set this folder to be a
bookmark, you will need to click the combo box and then click Other to
bring up the file chooser. By default the ripped files are stored in
the format discussed earlier with each artist as a folder and then
albums as subfolders. <br>

<br>

To rip the songs just select the checkboxes of the songs you want
ripped (by default all songs are selected), and then click Extract.
Each song is then stored in your Music folder, and the song titles are
used as the names of the files. <br>

<h4>
Ripping Songs as MP3s </h4>

Although the default Ogg support is recommended in most situations, you
may prefer to rip MP3 files if you have a digital audio player that
does not support Ogg files. To do this you need to configure Sound
Juicer to enable MP3 support. <br>

<br>

You should first install the gstreamer-10-ugly-multiverse package (from
the Multiverse repository). Next, in Sound Juicer click Edit &gt;
Preferences and click the Edit Profiles button. In the dialog box that
pops up, click New, call the profile MP3, and then select it from the
list and click Edit. <br>

<br>

Now fill in the settings with the following information: <br>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Profile Description</span>:
MP3
Encoder <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
GStreamer Pipeline</span>: audio/x-raw-int,rate=44100,channels=2
! lame
name=enc <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
File Extension</span>: mp3 <br>

</div>

<br>

Check the Active box, and click OK. Now close the Profiles dialog box,
and click Close to close the Preferences box. Restart Sound Juicer, and
you can now select MP3 from the Format combo box in the Preferences
box. <br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
A Word of Caution </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Always, always remember that ripping CDs that are not yours is piracy.
It's not fair, so don't do it! <br>

</div>

<h3>
Watching Videos </h3>

To watch videos in Ubuntu you need to ensure that you have the correct
codecs installed. As discussed earlier, some of these codecs are
available separately due to the legal implications of including them
with the Ubuntu system. Refer to the Ubuntu Wiki at
<a href="http://wiki.ubuntu.com/">http://wiki.ubuntu.com/</a>
for details of how to install them. <br>

<h4>
Using Totem </h4>

To watch videos in Ubuntu, you use the Totem media player (See Figure
3-42). Load it by clicking Applications &gt; Sound &amp; Video
&gt; Totem Media Player. <br>

<br>

<a href="3-42.png"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 697px; height: 546px;" alt="Totem is a simple and flexible media player." src="3-42.png"></a><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3-42 </span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Totem is a simple and flexible media player. </span><br>

<br>

To watch a video on your hard disk, click Movie &gt; Open and
select the file from the disk. &nbsp;<br>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Another Way to Load Files into Totem </h4>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
You can also load multimedia files into Totem by double-clicking them
on your desktop or in the file manager. <br>

</div>

<br>

Totem also supports video streams. To watch a stream, click Movie
&gt;
Open Location, and enter the Internet address for the stream. The video
feed is then loaded and displayed. <br>

<h3>
Getting DVDs to Work </h3>

Ubuntu comes with DVD support for unencrypted DVDs. With the DVD
industry being what it is, the majority of DVDs come encrypted, and if
you want to watch them you need to ensure that a library that can
decrypt these DVDs is installed. Unfortunately this library needs to be
installed separately and is not included with Ubuntu. Refer to the
Ubuntu wiki restricted formats page at
<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats</a>
for details. <br>

With the library installed, insert a disc into your computer, and
Ubuntu will automatically start Totem to view the disc. Alternatively,
fire up Totem, and click Movie &gt; Play Disc to play the DVD.
Totem
fully supports DVD menus and you can use the mouse to select the
different menu options. &nbsp;<br>

<br>

If you are settling down to watch a movie, there a few other settings
you may want to configure. First click View &gt; Aspect Ratio to
select
the correct aspect ratio for your screen, and then select View &gt;
Fullscreen to switch to full screen mode. To exit full screen, just
move your mouse, and some on screen controls will appear. <br>

<h3>
Control Totem with a Remote Control </h3>

Totem supports the Linux InfraRed Control (LIRC) library so you can use
a remote control while watching your media. <br>

<h2>
Summary </h2>

In this chapter you've learned how to start using the core features of
your new desktop. The concepts you have learned here should allow you
to perform most of the day-to-day tasks when using your computer and
provide a base from which to explore the other applications that are
installed on your system. This solid grounding in the desktop paves the
way for you to meander through the rest of the book, learning about the
more advanced uses of your new system and exploring the enormous
flexibility that Ubuntu provides. <br>

Always remember that there is a wealth of help and documentation
available online. If you ever find yourself stuck, take a look at the
Ubuntu Web site at www.ubuntu.com/ or the Ubuntu documentation at
<a href="http://help.ubuntu.com/">http://help.ubuntu.com/</a>
and make use of the forums, wiki, mailing
lists, and IRC channels. <br>
