    <title>Reporting Bugs in Ubuntu Server Edition</title>

  <para>
  While the Ubuntu Project attempts to release software with as few
  bugs as possible, they do occur. You can help fix these bugs by
  reporting ones that you find to the project.  The Ubuntu Project
  uses <ulink url="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</ulink>
  to track its bug reports. In order to file a bug
  about Ubuntu Server on Launchpad, you will need to
  <ulink url="https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/NewAccount">create
  an account</ulink>.

    <title>Reporting Bugs With ubuntu-bug</title>

    <para>
    The preferred way to report a bug is with the
    <application>ubuntu-bug</application> command. The ubuntu-bug
    tool gathers information about the system useful to developers in
    diagnosing the reported problem that will then be included in the
    bug report filed on Launchpad. Bug reports in Ubuntu need to be
    filed against a specific software package, thus the name of the
    package that the bug occurs in needs to be given to ubuntu-bug:
    </para>

<screen>
<command>ubuntu-bug PACKAGENAME</command>
</screen>

    <para>
    For example, to file a bug against the openssh-server package, you would do:
    </para>

<screen>
<command>ubuntu-bug openssh-server</command>
</screen>

    <para>
    You can specify either a binary package or the source package
    for ubuntu-bug. Again using openssh-server as an example,
    you could also generate the report against the source package
    for openssh-server, openssh:
    </para>

<screen>
<command>ubuntu-bug openssh</command>
</screen>

    <note>
    <para>
    See <xref linkend="package-management"/>
    for more information about packages in Ubuntu.
    </para>
    </note>

    <para>
    The ubuntu-bug command will gather information about the system in
    question, possibly including information specific to the specified
    package, and then ask you what you would like to do with collected
    information:
    </para>

<screen>
<command>ubuntu-bug postgresql</command>

*** Collecting problem information

The collected information can be sent to the developers to improve the
application. This might take a few minutes.

    <title>Reporting Application Crashes</title>

    <para>
    The software package that provides the ubuntu-bug utility, 
    <application>apport</application>, can be configured to trigger
    when applications crash. This is disabled by default, as capturing
    a crash can be resource intensive depending on how much memory
    the application that crashed was using as apport captures and
    processes the core dump.
    </para>

    <para>
    Configuring apport to capture information about
    crashing applications requires a couple of steps. First,
    <application>gdb</application> needs to be installed; it is not
    installed by default in Ubuntu Server Edition.
    </para>

<screen>
<command>sudo apt-get install gdb</command>
</screen>

    <para>
    See <xref linkend="package-management"/>
    for more information about managing packages in Ubuntu.
    </para>

    <para>
    Once you have ensured that gdb is installed, open the file
    <filename>/etc/default/apport</filename> in your text editor,
    and change the <emphasis>enabled</emphasis> setting to be
    <emphasis role="bold">1</emphasis> like so:
    </para>

<programlisting>
# set this to 0 to disable apport, or to 1 to enable it
# you can temporarily override this with
# sudo service apport start force_start=1
enabled=<userinput>1</userinput>

# set maximum core dump file size (default: 209715200 bytes == 200 MB)
maxsize=209715200
</programlisting>

    <para>
    Once you have completed editing
    <filename>/etc/default/apport</filename>,
    start the apport service:
    </para>

<screen>
<command>sudo start apport</command>
</screen>

    <para>
    After an application crashes, use the
    <application>apport-cli</application> command to search for the
    existing saved crash report information:
    </para>

<screen>
<command>apport-cli</command>

If you were not doing anything confidential (entering passwords or other
private information), you can help to improve the application by
reporting
the problem.

What would you like to do? Your options are:
  R: Report Problem...
  I: Cancel and ignore future crashes of this program version
  C: Cancel
Please choose (R/I/C):
</screen>

    <para>
    Selecting <emphasis>Report Problem</emphasis> will walk you through
    similar steps as when using ubuntu-bug. One important difference
    is that a crash report will be marked as private when filed on
    Launchpad, meaning that it will be visible to only a limited set
    of bug triagers. These triagers will review the gathered data for private
    information before making the bug report publicly visible.
    </para>

    <!-- Include a bit here on using apport-retrace for generating a
         full stack trace locally, for situations when the application
	 does contain confidential information that should not be
	 submitted to launchpad? -->
